Priyanka Desai was destined to be at the tip of the spear of any frontier of discovery. Her childhood home was an epicentre of learning and intellectual curiosity, principally orchestrated by her polymathic father.

In between loungeroom PowerPoint presentations, fiery dinner table political debates and gallivanting around the globe, a little thing known as the Bitcoin Whitepaper caught the eye of Priyanka and her family. That Whitepaper sowed the seed of curiosity.

Increasingly disenchanted with the sluggish bureaucracy of Capitol Hill, Priyanka Desai sought pastures new when she pivoted into the cryptographic ecosystem.

Her love of digital art and fervent desire to see a world where people have unobstructed access to communities of their choosing made her and DeFi a splendid match.

Priyanka Desai was destined to be at the tip of the spear of any frontier of discovery. Her childhood home was an epicentre of learning and intellectual curiosity, principally orchestrated by her polymathic father.

In between loungeroom PowerPoint presentations, fiery dinner table political debates and gallivanting around the globe, a little thing known as the Bitcoin Whitepaper caught the eye of Priyanka and her family. That Whitepaper sowed the seed of curiosity.

Increasingly disenchanted with the sluggish bureaucracy of Capitol Hill, Priyanka Desai sought pastures new when she pivoted into the cryptographic ecosystem.

Her love of digital art and fervent desire to see a world where people have unobstructed access to communities of their choosing made her and DeFi a splendid match.

Priyanka Desai tells her story in High Definition.
</h2><p>JACK: Welcome to high definition. Thank you so much for coming here and speaking with us, we really appreciate the time that you&#x27;ve taken to do this. Would you be able to start off by just telling us a little bit about yourself?

PRI:  Sure. And thanks so much for having me. It&#x27;s so fun. Um, yeah, sure. So I you know, I work on a project and run operations for a project called Open law we&#x27;ve put together and really focused and honed in on DAOs, which are decentralized autonomous organizations, we put together one venture specific DAO called the LAO which is an ode to this 2016 DAO which basically pulled a bunch of Ethereum and the goal was really to deploy that capital to different projects. It failed kind of pretty gloriously. And you know, that DAO hangover is over. So we created the LAO and we also have another DAO called Flamingo which is specifically in the non-fungible token space, which basically is like digital art collectibles and the like. I you know, before that was a student of the law in law school, and then through that kind of fell through the crypto rabbit hole, spent some time at a agency in New York that did something like the bid licensing work worked at our three, which is kind of in the FinTech, crypto space. Or at least they created their own Blockchain called Corda. And then before that worked in politics, on Capitol Hill, so I worked at a think tank and then spent a couple of years on Capitol Hill working on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. So it&#x27;s been quite a journey. And then I mean, I live in New York, too. So I guess that&#x27;s a little bit about me as well,

JACK: When you were working on Capitol Hill, either many people talking about crypto, is that where you got first exposed? Or was it in the news in 2017 or something?

PRI:  No, no. Um, so you know, the where I came to Bitcoin and crypto, I guess, was kind of an interesting story. I mean, Tech clearly was where things were moving. And I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee side. So you know, there was a few folks working on a big cybersecurity bill. So it felt like the future of warfare, in many ways was all going to be cyber and tech related. And so I mean, that just kind of expose me a little bit about the world of technology in many ways. And I&#x27;m not a technologist by any means. I definitely came more on the policy, politics side of things. But actually, it was more like dinner time conversation in my home. So my father was a bit of a gold bug. And so he would read a lot of Jim Rickards dying of money, like really into this notion of, like scarcity and what money is and so we just chat a little bit about it, I was super skeptical. And this was back in like 2012 2013 of, of this idea of Bitcoin or internet money or magic money, like it was still pretty emerging at that point. And like, I recall, even like, you couldn&#x27;t really purchase it anywhere. Like it was, it was it was difficult to come by. And so you know, it didn&#x27;t fully click for me and we would just kind of chat about it there. And I was also working in politics at the time. So there was also like a, there was a scholar at one of the think tanks that I follow that would write a little bit about Bitcoin. So I was mildly exposed to it. It wasn&#x27;t really until 2014 the summer of 2014, where I went to the British Museum one summer, and this is a summer before law school actually. I there was a small exhibit in there called like the past present and future of money and so it kind of just walked through what people would use initially it was like you know, peppers, beans, kind of walk you through, you know, paper gold gemstones, like everything and it would actually show you that show you what people are trading and then it went into credit cards and then after that, there were like pictures of Bitcoin and kind of more like expensive waiting what cryptocurrency was is like the future of money. And I think that&#x27;s when all this came together, we&#x27;re like seeing it next to, you know, peppers and credit cards, it made sense to me that you know it was going to evolve in this direction I went to so I kind of had that in my back pocket and I&#x27;m like, Okay, this is actually going to be something had that in my back pocket for law school actually saw the co-founder of open law and Aaron Wright quoted in an article about Bitcoin. He was a professor,  happen to be a professor at my law school met just reached out to him. We worked on a paper together my second year, and then I just worked for him my entire third year of law school, he would always kicked me out like the blockchain projects, because he ran a startup clinic. So he would just kind of kick that to me, I just started getting entrenched into that. And then 2017 was when I was graduating. And so it kind of had this, like, the timing was just unreal, like I was, you know, in law school during the DAO hack and everything that happened with the DAO and trying to figure out whether the DAO token was a security or not. So there was all this like, weirdness that was happening and a lack of regulation in the space. So yeah, the story is kind of a weird one. But yeah, a lot in there that that happen to lead me to where I am today. 

DAVE: Right. And I guess, like, it&#x27;s a quite a long history that you have, I guess, maybe describe the family environment that sort of fostered the interest in the first place. 

PRI: Yeah, fair enough. Um, so actually, like, my brother is actually quite involved in this space as well. So I guess, I mean, you could say that my father was, most of our dinnertime conversation revolved around finance and politics, we weren&#x27;t like, one to play games, or, or, you know, do the kind of typical family fun night thing. It was always like, really intense. Like, at one point, actually, like, just to kind of give you a sense of what my dad was like. So we would go on, like, my dad loved to travel. So really, really privileged in that way, where, you know, he took us everywhere, he was a super curious man. And so before any trip, we would go on, he would like make us put together like a PowerPoint presentation on like, sites and restaurants and things to do, and like, present it to the family. So it was like, kind of insane. But also, like, I think that just innate, like, having to dig and find things like it was almost like taught curiosity in many ways. And I think that that was definitely passed down to all of us kids, but, you know, you know, there was even to just kind of go beyond that, just to explain what kind of guy he is. And I actually even before going to Italy, we had like this Mitashi, like 18 hour DVD set, and he like, made us watch the entire set, it was super interesting about that family, but it was just to give you like a flavor of what he was like. So we would always like prep in these really, you know, intense ways. And I remember at one point, he like, literally would take out like whiteboards and would go through, like, what the Federal Reserve is, and how that relates to US government and how they&#x27;re actually not, and how it&#x27;s how the US Treasury is different than the Federal Reserve. And so, you know, that was kind of my childhood, and in many ways, and I think, you know, my dad read a lot, like, probably, you know, 12 to 13 hours a day, and he was an avid avid readers read, you know, everything we would get, you know, we my house was like, every newspaper, Foreign Affairs like CFR like everything from the right to left, like he read it all. So I think that&#x27;s where he initially like, discovered the Satoshi white paper, and he himself wasn&#x27;t actually a technologist at all, either. I think it was more actually, like more just, I think the whole ethos and the whole the 2008 crisis, which he was very, I mean, this guy might have is like, very much like a Zero Hedge reader. So he&#x27;s always been like a little disillusioned by the financial system, and that kind of thing. So I think seeing the white paper, and everything really awakened him a bit, and he shared that with us. And now I&#x27;m glad he did. I feel like that was a monumental, you know, piece of my life. And so that&#x27;s kind of what a little bit of my childhood looks like, here. 

DAVE: Right. And when did he first share that with you? Or when did you first discover the Bitcoin white paper? 

PRI: It&#x27;s a good question. I want to say 2011. Yeah, 

DAVE: So it&#x27;s pretty early. So yeah. 

PRI: Yeah, few years. Yeah, pretty early. I guess. It&#x27;s funny because you talk to people and they&#x27;re like, yeah, like I came in at. My least favorite thing is when people flex on when they discovered like, or when they came into this, it&#x27;s like, they&#x27;re really you are the better I guess, but it&#x27;s Yeah, I mean, I remember even like, you know, there was some senate hearings and stuff. I think first talking about Bitcoin in 2012. And he would always watch those. I mean, he&#x27;s been following. He was following it for quite some time. And yeah, so it was pretty early again, like, I was extremely skeptical. And I and I mean, you still hear this kind of rhetoric. But you know, this idea that it&#x27;s like, used for nefarious purposes, which I&#x27;m sure it still is today. And it was back then. But so I at first thought it was kind of like, not great. And actually, even in law school, like I remember, my internet law class, or professor was like, Yeah, I mean, like, the internet really grew from pornography. Like, there isn&#x27;t any major user like, God, why the internet design wise, even got better was the porn industry, because people like tried to have to, like finagle their way into like, using the internet to see that and like, that&#x27;s a good point, like, in many ways, like some of these emergent technologies, like always start with nefarious purposes, whether it be like, or if you define that as nefarious, like porn or gambling or like just pure speculation, like it always kind of starts weirdly. So I guess in retrospect, it made sense. But yeah, I guess you could say he&#x27;s pretty, pretty early. And I&#x27;m glad he shared it with us.

JACK:  Yeah, your dad seems like he&#x27;s not the average person. Now, what sort of components of, of his psyche do you think that you&#x27;ve, you&#x27;ve sort of adopted that have allowed you to become one of these pioneers in this space? 

PRI: You know, I kind of touched on this, but he&#x27;s pretty obsessive. So I when it comes to not really seeking truth, I think he&#x27;s someone who really would like try to dial in on that. And in many ways, so I think that like curiosity, when it comes to a particular subject of interests and obsession over something, I think, has been has, I guess, in many ways, entered my psyche I like, frankly, the internet also kind of facilitates that, like, if you&#x27;re curious on any subject, it&#x27;s pretty easy to do. So. I mean, yeah, I would say that&#x27;s a big one. I mean, even with the as far as, like, the things he enjoyed, which was like eating enjoy life, like wine, just having a good time, you know, trying new things. He&#x27;s, that&#x27;s definitely something that I would say actually, my siblings, and I all have from him. And so yeah, hugely influential in my life. 
DAVE: Sure. And I guess, to come to more the present, this sort of lands to where you are today, I guess, what did it take sort of you to get involved with LAO? What is the level represent what is maybe give a brief explanation of what it&#x27;s trying to achieve? 

PRI: Yeah, that&#x27;s kind of an interesting story. So I, as I mentioned, work with Aaron Wright and law school. And he hired me for a project called Open law, which, which the goal of open law is to create like wrappers around smart contracts. So smart contracts, you know, as you guys know, are this is this technical means to transfer one digital asset to another, whether that be tangible digital assets, like, you know, a piece of property or that can be assets that are intangible like crypto or something else, some other token. And so in order to like, give those assets in a real world, meaning you need to have a legal document associated with that. So we were creating legal wrappers for smart contracts. And you could still do that today. It&#x27;s an awesome protocol. And so we, we like internally as a team, you know, a lot of folks were using our public library. And I think there&#x27;s a lot of interest in what we were doing there. And so we kind of there was this emergent of conversation of DAWs. That started happening early 2019. A lot of that, I think, had to do with the fact that the Moloch DAW, which is a type of smart contract framework had come out. And so we as a team had been increasingly thinking about a nice dap to use the open law tools in and so the open law team and myself included, And, others have always really been passionate about this idea of digital organizations. And if you think about it like this, the idea of an organization really is a bunch of legal documents and paperwork, tying individuals and binding them to one another. And so it kind of we just were contemplating a bit. And we thought, Well, why not use open laws tooling to create an LLC, limited liability company wrappers, around smart contracts, we put together something pretty hacky just for people to use, and that got a lot of positive feedback. So we started thinking about it, like why not use open laws tooling to create a full blown digital organization where people can pull together capital and democratically vote on where that capital goes. So we started, you know, and creating a full dap, like a digital application or decentralized application around that. So like the user experience is super friendly. So we basically did that. So we started building that in the fall and then let it launch at the end of April. And really like the objective there is, like I said before, people pull together capital and work together and decide where they want to vote on that capital. Where that Capital goes and, and you know, it&#x27;s all wrapped in a Delaware Limited Liability Company, I guess in a holistic way. I mean, we are really kind of trying to push the boundaries on the future of coordination, human coordination on the internet, like right now, in many ways, like people are coordinating on the internet, but it&#x27;s kind of in these like disparate silos, there&#x27;s not a lot of it makes it difficult for them to, like, make decisions together. And there&#x27;s really not like, a way to pull money together. Like I can&#x27;t even really I mean, there, I guess there&#x27;s like Kickstarter and such, but like, there&#x27;s to actually, like, make decisions quickly, operationally, in a way that, you know, all the accounting is on the back end, and you can be from anywhere. So we kind of that that whole notion that really like, which I think personally is like a killer app of blockchain and Ethereum. Anyway, hasn&#x27;t I mean, it&#x27;s been done. And people in the DAO tried to do that in 2016. Unfortunately, you know, we know that there&#x27;s that hack, and there was like, some legal structuring issues around it. But we really wanted to bring that vision to life. So you know, now that the timing is right, and people are more online than ever, it just makes a ton of sense to really start creating organizations digitally and having people coordinate on the internet. I think that&#x27;s definitely where the things are going. So it&#x27;s pretty exciting. 

DAVE: Right? And in that vein, I guess maybe speak to what that vision is of Ethereum doubt, as it was originally conceived. And I guess, how do you see companies forming within the next 10 years? 

PRI: Yeah, so the Ethereum DAO, I guess, for those who aren&#x27;t familiar was this massive project that was quite amazing. In 2016, where similarly to the LAO members pulled together, I think it was close to at the time $160 million, were pulled together. And there was a massive, so and the idea similarly, is everyone would get a token, they would vote with that token, to declare, like, they&#x27;d want to fund x project, that project would get funded, and it kind of just, you know, float, I think, I think that from what my memory serves, that&#x27;s kind of generally how they were thinking about the structure, then, unfortunately, it was like a massive, massive security vulnerability and the smart contracts. And a lot of that money got hacked, there was a huge, you know, debate on, I think, two debates, like whether the money should go back to people and they should, you know, hard fork it, or, you know, also whether or not they&#x27;ve even made sense from like, the legal philosophical perspective, like, this is what people signed up for, if code is law, then like, we shouldn&#x27;t necessarily go back to it. And, and I mean, not to go too much in the weeds here. But there was also like, in addition to all of the kind of which I think this gets lost in the conversation is there was really little legal structuring around this around the original DAO in 2016. So, you know, if there is no legal structure around a certain organization like that, when you&#x27;re pulling capital together, the default is that you&#x27;re a general partnership. And that can, what that means is basically your liability could be on a personal level too. And that that, of course, could get a little dicey. Right. So you know, with the LAO, which we actually have the L in front of it&#x27;s a limited liability company. So meaning that you&#x27;re only like your liability is limited to your contribution amount. 

DAVE: Right. And I guess, to come to the point of where we&#x27;re going, Yeah, it&#x27;s clear where we&#x27;re at 85% of the world&#x27;s, you know, what value is locked up in private, limited companies? How do you think companies will form in the future? 

PRI: I mean, I think it&#x27;s going to look a lot like what we&#x27;re doing here, I think it&#x27;s going to be, I do think like putting together the operating agreements will become a lot more seamless and quick wrapped, if you will, I think that you&#x27;re going to have like, which I mean, in many ways, like a lot of that is, is fairly standard and boilerplate But then I also just think, you know, the ability to spin up a DAO for your community and like re skin, that is going to be a lot easier. So like the way I kind of see it, and this probably will evolve into something a little bit more cohesive, because right now it&#x27;s like you have, we have like the DAP where you connect your wallet, and then you do the voting decisions. And then all the conversation happens on like a Discord. For example, I would imagine at some point, it gets a little more seamless, and everything&#x27;s connected a little bit better. But for the most part, I mean, I think it&#x27;s going to be like these guests, you know, there&#x27;s going to be a group of members that coordinate with one another and just have conversations and, you know, obviously, there&#x27;s some like stickiness with, with like, you know, that you&#x27;re never going to get rid of some of these offline kind of touch points like the legal world in the real world. But I do think that every organization is going to be online at some point and it&#x27;s just going to be easier to coordinate because we&#x27;ll have like better applications to serve those communities I also what I also kind of think is cool about this technology is that unlike current organizations today, like you, you&#x27;re not, you can actually like technologically like, bind some of these orgs. For example, with the LAO, like we joined another, we kind of like built a bridge to another DAO and contributed directly to that DAO. So kind of having these, like smart contracts that connect to other organizations is kind of interesting as well. So I think there&#x27;s a lot of fun stuff that will emerge. And I think some of these organizations are going to be connected to one another&#x27;s, you&#x27;re going to almost have like this Hydra of like, a bunch of different organizations that have, like, a stake or connection to another organization, and it&#x27;s going to look pretty, pretty interesting.

JACK: And why do you think it&#x27;s important we continue in this direction? 

PRI: Um, that&#x27;s a good question, actually. I think I mean, I guess the answer that I guess most people would say, is it, it opens opportunities to people who normally wouldn&#x27;t have them. I think there&#x27;s a lot of operational efficiencies that are inefficiencies that get lost in corporations and organizations today, but mostly, I mean, to the to the first point I made, I mean, I think that this gives people the ability just to like, open a computer, get internet connection, and, and join an organization and join a community and make decisions on that community. I think that frees up a lot, I guess, I think that kind of breaks the barriers a bit for people to like, join certain things that they believe in. I mean, for example, now, and I guess maybe this may or may not be true, but I also like a lot of what decision a lot of decision making that happens today is concentrated to like corporations or organizations in major touchpoints around the world to like major cities, it&#x27;s confined to a few major power brokers who generally get those opportunities before others, I think, you know, being able to just be curious, dig, find a community coordinate amongst a group of people that are like minded and interested in in the same things as you is pretty powerful and somewhat difficult to do in the real world I think so having the ability to do that is pretty great.

JACK:  Is that why you got into the space? Or to see that sort of feature eventuate? Or is there a different reason? And that became that over time? 

PRI: Well, I always thought DAOs were cool. I mean, just, I mean, simply because, I mean, it is like the future organization, human coordination, being able to pull capital, but you know, I it&#x27;s a, that&#x27;s not what I thought I would be doing at this point, like I, you know, I thought, I don&#x27;t know what I thought I would really, there was no like, clear objective, I think it was one of those things where you like, find things that interests you along the way. And like, with DAOs, it made clear sense after the DAO I recall even writing like a paper on securities law on the DAO because I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that, ever. And, you know, then from there, following what Aragon was doing a bit. So, I mean, I was looking at it from afar, and then we kind of were lucky enough to, to really, I would I was lucky enough to be on a team that was pushing in that direction. I think it makes a ton of sense. But yeah, it&#x27;s interesting to ask the question of like, what I set out to do, I mean, like, frankly, I really believed in open law, the team. And I&#x27;m like, really just trying to see that through this idea of opening up. I think crypto in general, the reason I got in and blockchain technology was this, you know, democratic access to money organizations, you know, the monetary policy is such that it&#x27;s kind of already decided for the group. And so I mean, I, I came in from that vantage point. And I feel like now I&#x27;m just kind of along for the ride, I crypto changes so quickly that I have no idea what&#x27;s going to happen to DAO within the next like year or two. I mean, I think it could be like one of those things that we&#x27;re just gonna see 1000s of them, they&#x27;re all gonna be connected in some sort of web. So didn&#x27;t necessarily set out to work in DAOs, but it&#x27;s worked out.

JACK:  I can&#x27;t help but notice, you said at the side of the conversation that you were injured, that you were introduced to the white paper of Bitcoin around 2011. That also seems to coincide with when you started as a junior policy analyst at the House Committee of Foreign Affairs, and you were there for about two years over that course of your time there. Did the narrative of Bitcoin changed your life trajectory and get you to leave that position? That stable position? 

PRI: Yeah, um, you know, I mean, the truth is, I like wanted to get out of politics. It was like getting pretty, like I was I was sort of done with it. And so I will say like on the on the Foreign Affairs side of things. I mean, I keep it in my back pocket, this idea of crypto and what&#x27;s going on, but it wasn&#x27;t discussed as much publicly at the time, I would say like what was discussed was kind of closing before like cybersecurity and cyber warfare. There&#x27;s definitely like a bill that was very that basically consumed much of the staff. And so that was always like, where things were going. And you could feel it. And, you know, hackers and all that. But I mean that that was I know, it sounds it wasn&#x27;t that long ago, but like, no one was really talking about crypto at the time, it was something that I would talk about with my family, but and maybe a few friends. But even then, like I would say, most of my friends thought it was a little bit strange. Yeah, I mean, it wasn&#x27;t really until much later, where it really kind of started to make a little more sense to me. But Sorry, I wanted to add another point on the Foreign Affairs side. Oh, yeah, the reason I left really was I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Like, it&#x27;s funny. Now we like look at politics today. And like, Wow, I can&#x27;t possibly imagine things getting so polarized, but at the time, it was it felt so I can&#x27;t imagine being in DC right now. I think at the time, I thought it was too much for me. And, you know, getting anything done is really difficult. So on the committee side, the way it works is, like, you know, you kind of have to draft and go back and forth and negotiate with third party interests, you know, the minority staff what&#x27;s going on with the Senate and the senate staff. So there&#x27;s so many interested parties. And so like, by the time this bill that you&#x27;re kind of excited about or like this provision that you&#x27;re excited about gets added in becomes something that&#x27;s completely different after so you kind of become a little bit disillusioned by that. And I guess, if anything kind of dislike and anti-establishment institutional rhetoric that I feel like a lot of people in crypto and blockchain had, if anything, like I would say, my experience there probably compounded that feeling. So I think like, there&#x27;s a lot of things that are broken, and, you know, politics in some ways, being one of them. But yeah, that that was kind of my impetus for going to law school, I was I was ready for like to push on the next thing and, and really like dig in, I mean, but admittedly, like a tradition, like I thought I was going to be more of like a traditional lawyer, not necessarily like helping on the operation side of digital organization. So things definitely change. 

JACK: Yeah. Would you say that the DAO structure is almost competing with that bureaucratic structure that you see in DC?
 
PRI: Um, well, I would hope that it&#x27;s a little more streamlined. Maybe not? Not? I mean, I don&#x27;t think so now, perhaps, maybe, I mean, I think they&#x27;re probably some, at least not our DAOs. But I&#x27;m sure that they&#x27;ll be some doubt communities where politics, you can&#x27;t really get rid of human nature. So I think like, I&#x27;m sure things may become a little bit bureaucratic are difficult at times, or there might be some conflict. But I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, it. Hopefully with this, I mean, you have like these clean votes where an address is tied to and you can kind of move forward. But I mean, you never know, things could get like interesting in this space as well. I really, really hope it doesn&#x27;t get like too bureaucratic, though, I think that would, that would kind of cut against the general ethos of what we&#x27;re trying to do here. But I will say like, of the participants so far in this community, no one people have a pretty similar view on bureaucracy, I would say. So, hopefully, it doesn&#x27;t creep in. 

DAVE: Yeah, I guess there&#x27;s a clear line to draw between nation states and companies, they&#x27;re quite different. But I guess if politics is broken, how would we fix it? And is what you&#x27;re building offering to do so? 

PRI: It&#x27;s a good question. I mean, politics is broken for a lot of reasons. You know, for me, personally, there&#x27;s a lot of and I mean, the founding fathers even like warned on some of these items of like special interests getting in the way and you know, campaign finance and, and all these like third parties that actually in favors and all of that, that ends up kind of creeping in from what is supposed to be in the best interests of people. I mean, what we&#x27;re building is fully transparent you know, you have this organization where proposals if they want to be can be public, you know, who&#x27;s in the group, you can chat I mean, people can be anonymous or not, but I mean, that&#x27;s not to say admittedly, that it could it could get dicey it really just depends on the people you have a little more flexibility with what you can do with the technology so if there is a bad actor or someone&#x27;s you know, operating in a way that necessarily isn&#x27;t aligned with the majority of people like you can there are features such as like rage kicking someone if it doesn&#x27;t work out or, or if someone feels like it&#x27;s not a good fit for them. Or if the whole you know, organization feels like it&#x27;s heading in a direction that you don&#x27;t believe in you can rage quit the organization move on. So I think what&#x27;s different here is like you have this fluidity to move about that may or may not exist today. You don&#x27;t necessarily feel locked into something, you if an organization or like a DAO dies or runs out of capital. If you don&#x27;t like it anymore, you can leave. And we&#x27;re that a subculture sub community that DAO can create another DAO and I think that you&#x27;re going to see a little bit more like life and death. And they might have a shorter life cycle than what we see today, which actually just might be healthier. Hopefully we can avoid like these, like too big to fail scenarios or, like just one doubt, kind of consuming and other than just getting too large and that kind of thing. I mean, I&#x27;m hoping that we have like more of a fluid structure. And it&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re seeing today. 

JACK: I think I&#x27;m keen to take a step, sorry, take a step back. And think how this would impact the everyday person. So someone that doesn&#x27;t know about crypto, just walking down the street? How does what we&#x27;re talking about today impact to them? 

PRI: Yeah, yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. So I mean, there, it&#x27;s one that is kind of interesting, because I like talk to my friends a lot about it, who aren&#x27;t familiar with their space. So they&#x27;re like, Okay, so what exactly do you do? What is it? What we know? Why is it? Why should I be interested in or how does it work? And so, I mean, I think the way that it impacts them is kind of related to the previous point about it being super fluid and this ability to meet people and join a community that has similar belief system as you and benefiting from that belief system, and, you know, coordinating with other people that you agree with and making decisions based on that. I mean, I think that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to do that, like, for example. And this is kind of how I tried to explain it in many ways. It&#x27;s, you know, you have these groups on traditional social media like or other like, you know, information hubs, I guess, like so you could have like a subset community or Reddit community, or a discord community related to like, a group of like-minded people, everyone has interests, everyone has, you know, something, imagine, you know, then adding some sort of internal currency or community currency, having some sort of way to literally take that community and make productive decisions based on that. So it&#x27;s not just like, you know, some Facebook group that Facebook owns, you can now actually have some autonomy in this group and coordinate with one another to make decisions that may benefit you all, or give that community member a way to earn a token or something of that nature. I mean, the possibilities really, they&#x27;re kind of endless, but I guess the way I think it affects regular, you know, anyone who may not be familiar with crypto is if you are part of a specific group online, which I think is many people today, whether even be on Twitter, your you know, you check, you know, a certain type of following that you&#x27;re curious about, if you are able to engage with those people meet them, and then coordinate with them through some sort of token that kind of threads all of you together, I think that&#x27;s pretty powerful. And you could start doing some really interesting things with that and make interesting decisions. And I mean, like, in the law, for example, we chose to pull Ethan and invest in various projects in the ecosystem, but you know, I, I&#x27;m a part of some other communities that are interested in, in like, varied subjects, and they&#x27;re thinking of really, you know, cool ways to take the Treasury and, and allocate capital to people that manage the Treasury or people who manage the community. So you can start having these roles within the community. And again, like, you know, throwing a party for the, the discord group, if you will, or it could be something that&#x27;s way more interesting, like, I don&#x27;t know, creating like a nonprofit for something. So there&#x27;s a lot of opportunities that people can come together and do that are so like, that are way beyond what exists right now in the community. And also, you know, that can relate to what exists on Reddit and others. So, yeah, I think it seems like very portable to, to what we have on the internet today. 

JACK: Do you spend like all your waking hours looking at this? I mean, it&#x27;s pretty deep topic. And the way the space moves, is so rapid that it&#x27;s almost like if you take a second away from the screen, you&#x27;re missing out on something big. Do you have time for any of your other hobbies? Or have you sacrificed all of those to dive into this?

PRI: No, I have not sacrificed all this but I will say like this, the space moves insanely fast like within I would say the last year we had a bear market we had defy which is decentralized finance summer, we have this boom for non-fungible tokens. So like digital art, collectibles and everything and now we have like this emergence of social tokens social community token so like the speed of which things are moving and the communities you need to participate in and the people you need to talk to and crypto Twitter and everything it&#x27;s, you know, exhausting and but at the same time, like it&#x27;s kind of addictive, like there&#x27;s so much new innovation, so many interesting, smart people that are constantly just doing more and more interesting. So I mean, yeah, I would say that I am on a computer a lot part of that has to do with COVID, I would say more than normal. But no, I mean outside of all of this and you know, constantly keeping up with the cool projects and talking to cool projects and making friends within the community which honestly has been one of the most awesome things about being a part of the DAO like it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s been really amazing to see the DAO members like the LAO members as well. And even the Flamingo which is the NFTO community members like actually kind of get to know each other and become friends, it seems like our help each other on different projects. I think that&#x27;s kind of an understated benefit of some of these DAOs, like you meet all these people that are interested in the stuff that you are, and you can kind of just grow into getting to know them in many ways. But it was kind of a tangent, but I would say outside of, you know, really plugging into the crypto blockchain stuff online, I try to spend a ton of time on art, I&#x27;ve been like, kind of slowly building my collection this year, have saved a little bit of money from the fact that I just am not going out to eat or doing anything. And I gave up my lease in New York. So I&#x27;ve been trying to support some of the arts and buying things that I really like. And so I mean, that&#x27;s definitely a passion of mine. And when I was, you know, in New York, I was able to go to a couple shows and museums and stuff, which so it&#x27;s nice to get a little bit of culture and also just, you know, I would say outside of what I&#x27;m doing today, that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ve been focusing on, as well as like, I think in this weird COVID time just trying to call up friends and family. Um, I think that&#x27;s honestly been kind of a concerted effort, you know, making sure that people are engaged in and well.

DAVE: Right, and maybe speak to the ad hoc a little bit more, and how crypto sort of more facilitated? 

PRI: Yeah, yeah. So it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s interesting, I&#x27;ve been, you know, interested in art for a while, part of what I kind of liked about crypto also is this idea of putting digital prop property online, that digital property can be anything from real estate to, you know, an artwork, or really any kind of tangible item can be digitized through some sort of token framework. And so, we on the LAO side had been thinking about this idea of non-fungible tokens and, and this emergence of digital art, meaning artwork that sits on chain through a token and its reference. And so like, it kind of has all of these trademarks of traditional art where you can have like scarcity. And you can have actually better provenance because you know exactly what hands are holding a piece of artwork. And so there&#x27;s been like a lot of talk and excitement around digital art. Actually, I would say like, even early in the days of open law, like I would say, like 2018, a lot of galleries, a lot of auction houses, others were thinking about art provenance and Blockchain like kind of, similarly, we saw a lot of those supply chain use cases. And so we&#x27;re kind of you know, where the provenance is being you would take like a physical artwork, and then put that into tokens, so you can better track the provenance of that work. And now we&#x27;re seeing just artwork generated online, with the token, and then you know, people have a collection that they have online and can display it. And so it&#x27;s this, in a way, an entirely emergent art form, where you have this token that represents an artwork, people have an address tied to their collection. So you can go on someone&#x27;s, you know, account on a website, look at their address, and see what&#x27;s in their wallet, which is kind of fun, and just see, like, observe what tastes people have, and you know, what kind of art certain folks are looking at. So there&#x27;s all these great platforms where people can kind of, and I often do this, like, look and see what other people are buying and selling. And so that&#x27;s just been completely in boom, like, I mean, some of the numbers are insane. There was this digital artists, BEEPLE that had like a $3.5 million weekend selling his work. So the space has just been explosive. It&#x27;s interesting now I think because I mostly have been interested in like a the traditional art sense, like I mean, I have been watching NFT&#x27;s and was interested in crypto kitties after I saw an auction in 2017, where crypto kitty went for $140,000 I thought that was like, completely insane. But you know, I&#x27;ve been watching from afar and seeing all this great, great digital artwork that was emerging. And what we&#x27;re seeing now is actually a lot of like, well known musicians, a lot of digital artists and like the contemporary art world are starting to take notice, because folks like BEEPLE are making $3.5 million in a weekend and so it&#x27;s kind of seeing both worlds like collide a bit. So I&#x27;ve like followed a few digital artists in the past and now like this kind of gives them a medium to actually like buy trade, sell their work. So it&#x27;s kind of you know, digital art has always been like a weird spot in the in the contemporary art market. And I think this like, fits really nicely. So it&#x27;s nice seeing like, these kind of more traditional artists explore a new medium.

JACK: And outside of just buying NFT&#x27;s. How are you also helping that industry grow? 

PRI: Yeah. So you know, what the members of allow there&#x27;s definitely like a cabal of members that are super into digital art and NFT&#x27;s. And so, you know, at some point, like, there was, I think, a member that was like, Well, why doesn&#x27;t allow by some digital artwork, we can, you know, just kind of buy some cool pieces, and it can be part of our portfolio. And the conversation just kind of went from there. And then we started discussing it and like, Well, why don&#x27;t we have art collective of members similar to the LAO, but they&#x27;re more like on the art, you know, digital property gaming enthusiasts world and create a collective around that. And we could, you know, have smart contracts operate in the background, it could be a limited liability company. So we, from that kind of idea that allow member incubated we created Flamingo, which is an NFT art collective where members basically are well, it&#x27;s actually beyond just art. I think it goes to gaming and other collectibles, but it&#x27;s an NFT collective, where members can come together and purchase, you know, anything from digital art to gaming assets, to digital land in different metal verses where you know, the idea eventually is to create a digital museum that displays all the digital artwork and collectibles. And then, you know, other kind of metaverse base, non-fungible token. So I mean, that&#x27;s kind of it&#x27;s I mean, it&#x27;s an interesting group of people. He ranges from, like digital artists, to people who&#x27;ve been early in the scene to even like the venture capital types who are really like, excited by this space, you know, traditional art collectors. So I think there&#x27;s a nice mix of people in there. And so I mean, outside of my personal collecting, and kind of watching the space and seeing different artists I see on like Superar, and other artists. And also, frankly, I&#x27;ve been like, I&#x27;ve always kind of followed a bunch of artists on Instagram and like seeing a bunch of them talk about NFTs organically has been pretty interesting as well. So I mean, flamingos doing a lot in that vantage point, I think it&#x27;d be kind of interesting to see them help Shepherd some traditional artists into this space too which I hope will be the case. 

JACK: It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s cool that you said a lot of the people that you&#x27;re following on Instagram are becoming interested in this space. But one thing that I commonly notice is an everyday person looking at NFT&#x27;s, which is digital art, in a sense, and saying, look, I can just take a screenshot, and I have it too. So what would you say to someone who argues that point? 

PRI: Yeah, if you hear that one a lot, like I sure I get it. I mean, I think it&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a complete, actually, frankly, if I had a work and everyone was screenshotting, and sharing it, I&#x27;d probably welcome it because it would just increase the value of my own work. I mean, at the same time ownership, you know, the scarcity. In addition, a number also matters, whether or not that&#x27;s digital work or physical one, I don&#x27;t think actually makes a ton of difference. And I&#x27;ve actually heard this, you know, quite a bit, but this idea of like, a Mona Lisa, like owning a Mona Lisa, and taking a picture or having a print of a Mona Lisa, or, or whatever is not the same thing. So I mean, one can Yes, like, take a screenshot and share it. And that&#x27;s probably welcomed by an owner but owning it and then having that like sense of ownership over an NF t are not the same things, I think so I think it&#x27;s kind of one of those just fundamental human nature of having some sense of ownership over like a rare item, or I think kind of translates actually in the digital realm. But yeah, that that screenshot arguments kind of interesting, I think, like, I think people it&#x27;s like, sorry, I do think that we&#x27;re gonna kind of like see this kind of emergence of people having their wallet address with their artwork. And I think you see it on Superar another and even open see where people like really like the idea of sharing that link. And like letting others see their collection, I think like that feeling is not going to go away. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to like, going to some someone&#x27;s like home and seeing their artwork. I know it might sound a little like odd now, but I do think that whether or not you own add it, whether or not it&#x27;s in your wallet, and people can see it is actually going to kind of increasingly matter in this space. Sorry.

DAVE: Right. That&#x27;s okay. I guess in that vein, how do you think the future looks different than today for digital content credits in that sense? 

PRI:  Yeah. I think that kind of speaks to this new community and social tokens that we&#x27;re seeing so you know, if you are a content creator and they&#x27;re kind of glimmers of this already, like you&#x27;re kind of seeing in the traditional media world, like these content creators that gain popularity through, you know, just readership through like a publication or just through Twitter or something like, you know, an individual platform that could be anything from tick-tock to YouTube or whatever. Like we were seeing on the web tour where people are building influence and clout, um, based on themselves rather than like a record label or, or a, or a publication. And so, um, I kind of think the next phase of that for these content creators is going to be tokenizing themselves. So being able to tether themselves to their audience and fans directly, I think will give the content creator a ton of flexibility and power that you don&#x27;t necessarily see today. It&#x27;s like, we&#x27;re kind of seeing a little bit of that with like sub stack and others that it&#x27;s like, you, you you&#x27;re Glenn Greenwald, you did the intercept. Okay, cool. You built an audience. People have been following you, you go create a sub staff, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for everyone. And like, if anything, it might not really work at, it might not be long-term sustainable. So this idea of creating a token, having a group of fans of yours and readers of yours actually own that token, have that token to get access to your newsletter, had that token to maybe redeem merchandise that you have or whatever you end up doing with that. Or like, you know, you have an early album release, you can give it to your early fans who hold X of tokens. I think there&#x27;s a lot of fun stuff you can play with in that. And I think that&#x27;s really creating a community around a content creator is probably more important than having like, you know, a Twitter account associated with them. I think having the fans also get to know each other, even like a DAO format, I think eventually you&#x27;re going to kind of see these, uh, content creators have like DAOs where their communities will also have like this financial mobility where they can like come together and create merchandise and sell that merchandise to the community for that, you know, sub token. So I think that there&#x27;s some fun stuff to play with content creators. I&#x27;m super interested in that space where, you know, we&#x27;re seeing that a little bit here and there a few people in the crypto space have started tokenizing themselves. There&#x27;s a few token based communities like on discord, what you need, you know, X amount of tokens to enter the discord, um, a few members, like if you have a certain token amount, you can be a multi-stakeholder and make, you know, based on vote, like make certain capital allocation. So I think we&#x27;re slowly seeing the emergence of that, but I think for a certain content creator that you could create like fully a brand around a token. And so I think that&#x27;s pretty, pretty interesting and, and likely we&#x27;ll pop off this year. Um, I think there&#x27;s a lot of talk.

DAVE: Right. And why is that important? Why do you find that compelling? 

PRI: I find it compelling. And I think why it made sense to me immediately was actually after talking to Bradley Abelow, I mean, I, at first I was a little skeptical. I&#x27;m like, ah, I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this, this idea of someone just like, you know, creating shares of themselves. Like that seems so strange. Like they&#x27;re beholden to this audience. Like I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it. And then I talked to Bradley Abelow we were just chatting a little bit and it kind of just made it started making more sense to me after having like deeper conversations. I mean, like right now, if you think about it, many of these content creators, whether that be like Instagram, Instagram influencers or Twitter influencers, a lot of them are beholden to like sponsored content. A lot of them get their money from these third parties, which actually in many ways is like not even authentic to themselves or their audience. So, um, if you ha if you give them the ability to completely circumvent all of that, to like survive and have a token that not only can yes, support themselves, but also give them and their audience, the ability to like run with that community and give them autonomy of that community rather than again, being beholden to some third party, I think is pretty, pretty powerful and will likely like, again, it&#x27;s, you are, you have to kind of keep that community engaged and keep it going. But I do think the alternative of like having to sell something on your Instagram, just, I think that&#x27;s a little outdated. And so having like this community and sub-communities all in your domain currency is pretty powerful. And, and what I like even like about that is the subcultures that can emerge within your own community. I mean, they could even fork off and, and like, you could be like, I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m X content creator. And there&#x27;s a group of super fans that are like, okay, like why don&#x27;t we create, um, merge for X? Uh, we&#x27;ll make it all like bought and sold, um, in, in this token and, and people like it&#x27;ll only grow the network value if people are transacting in that token. So I think that&#x27;s pretty powerful and there&#x27;s a lot that can be done there. And I just liked the idea of that. I think, um, there&#x27;s just going to be more and more of that. It&#x27;s like really decentralizing Reddit communities in many ways.

JACK: Do you, do you like the idea more so of the fact that you can connect the content creator with the community? So like for example, Kanye with the people that follow and listen to Kanye West, the idea of cutting out Spotify, cutting out Apple music, which of those two ideas is the reason that you like it? Or is it a combination of both? Yeah.

PRI: Yeah. It&#x27;s definitely both. I mean, the thing with the tokens is like, you know, Kanye doesn&#x27;t even need to necessarily approve the token. Like you could have a person who, you know, is a mega fan and can rally a bunch of Kanye people. Obviously it&#x27;d be better if, if Kanye was a part of that, you could retroactively give the Kanye token to all of his followers and it would just kind of build momentum and, and kind of like-minded people who are all part of the community. So, I mean, I think that makes sense, but as far as like the record labels and you know, what&#x27;s going on with Apple music and Spotify, which I know a lot of people have been writing about and talking about as being like tremendously extractive, you know, there are a lot of musicians that don&#x27;t even put their albums on Spotify, but now also they&#x27;re like kind of, strong-armed putting them because they&#x27;re like missing out all this money. Because everyone, you know, buys and listens to music through Spotify. So they don&#x27;t really have a choice. And so I think giving people options, like it&#x27;s just too, it&#x27;s like the creators actually end up losing in this because they just don&#x27;t have many options, which is unfortunate. So it&#x27;s not like they have that mobility, um, to really like even weave that. So, I mean, you&#x27;re stuck to these kind of warm siloed relationships that music musicians have with the streamers and the record labels. It just kind of, you know, along for this, and I think this kind of cuts outside of that, it could be in parallel to it, but it does free them up quite a bit. So I mean, like, you know, I don&#x27;t think Spotify is per going anywhere, but I would love to see actually eventually is having like back to the Apple music days where you paid like 99 cents for a song, like if you could have like micro, micro, micro transactions and pay, like instead of paying Spotify, like nine bucks a month, you could just like pay like a 10th of a cent to listen to a song or whatever. I think something like that will emerge and that&#x27;ll be interesting, but, you know, the way it sits now. Yeah. I mean, I do think that this is something that musicians can do and it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s more of like, like I was saying in parallel to, to this behemoth that is like Apple music and Spotify and labels and all of that. Like,  I don&#x27;t see this as like per se antagonistic to labels. So it perhaps that could be a good edge in as far as changing the industry.

JACK: Is that something that you&#x27;re going to devote some time to this coming year? Or where, where are you going to devote your time to?

PRI: And the social token space just kind of casually, like I&#x27;ve found it super interesting. And so I started participating in a few communities of people who had been talking pretty deeply about this stuff. You know, the, through that and through some of what the LAO members have expressed interest in. I think a lot of people see social tokens or community tokens as the next frontier in this space. I mean, I guess perhaps not the next frontier, but something that&#x27;s like an emergent trend. A lot more people are doing it. Uh, we saw, we were seeing some fairly prominent like musicians start thinking about it. We&#x27;ve gotten some feedback on, on, from some musicians as well that are interested in moving in this direction. We saw RAC tokenize, himself a few months back, and that was really successful and they have some really fun things. It, you know, planned on how to actually use a token. Um, so like, and like what they can do with it, what the utility of this token will be. And so the Portugal, the man, I think this past week tokenized, um, themselves. And so I think we&#x27;re going to see a lot more of that. And I, if anything, I think it&#x27;s going to be a huge way to, I think it&#x27;s going to be a major factor in getting a lot of young people and perhaps non-native crypto users on boarded into crypto. I think that this, this, this idea of decentralizing content creators from a platform. And again, I didn&#x27;t really touch on this, but this is like the token allows a content creator to port onto whatever platform they want. So like, if they don&#x27;t want to be an Instagram, they can take their audience elsewhere. And I think that&#x27;s pretty powerful, but I think this ability to create a community around a token and give it, empower the community, use the token, or use that token to, you know, engage your community and reward them. It is going to just be a huge phenomenon that happens like in the next year. I&#x27;m , I feel very strongly about that fact. I do think it&#x27;s definitely something we&#x27;re going to see. And actually on our side, we&#x27;re thinking about a DAO specific to social token. So the members could basically pull together a capital and support various content creators or artists and provide capital for a specific social token. So that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve discussed and I know a lot of members seem to be interested in, but yeah, I think that it&#x27;s going to be big this year. And like I said, I think it&#x27;s just going to get so many people interested into this.
And like, I tried to talk to my friends about these ideas and whether or not they make sense, like I even get some skepticism on this idea of like digital art and like, to your point, like, well, why not just screenshot it? Or like, what&#x27;s the point, but with the social tokens and like community tokens, I, I think a lot of people&#x27;s feedback is like, Oh, that actually does make sense. I kind of, I can see that. So I can imagine a world where like JENZY and other Tiktok type of influencers are starting to move in this direction. So let&#x27;s stay tuned there. Maybe like Kanye will have his own token this year.

JACK: Yeah, definitely. And if you do make some headways in finding out the next trends, or if you&#x27;re going to post those on Twitter and whatnot, where should we follow you? If you have a community token that you release, where should we go find that?

PRI: I haven&#x27;t done that. But maybe, maybe once maybe if I make it one day I&#x27;ll, I&#x27;ll, I&#x27;ll issue a pre token. But, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I try to, you know, post fun articles that I read and random thoughts PRI Desai on Twitter.
