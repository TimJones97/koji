It was only a matter of time before his desire to make a mark and help others make their mark led him to DeFi.

After finishing a chemistry PhD, DeFi Dad pivoted into a completely different world by establishing a cookie baking business on the West Coast. Over 3 years he grew that business to 20 people before the haunting aromas of global change overpowered the smells from the oven. Always up for a challenge, he immersed himself in DeFi podcasts and literature, often studying from when he got home from work to the early hours of the morning.

His persistence paid off when he landed a job at Consensys and took charge of the Ethereal Summits. Within a short space of time he had journeyed from being a bewildered attendant at the conference to its organiser.

Now the host of Yield TV and a core member of Zapper, DeFi Dad’s meteoric rise mirrors that of the DeFi world. Somehow, through all of this, the Dad of DeFi still finds the time to be a Dad at home.

Here’s his story, in High Definition.

It was only a matter of time before his desire to make a mark and help others make their mark led him to DeFi.

After finishing a chemistry PhD, DeFi Dad pivoted into a completely different world by establishing a cookie baking business on the West Coast. Over 3 years he grew that business to 20 people before the haunting aromas of global change overpowered the smells from the oven. Always up for a challenge, he immersed himself in DeFi podcasts and literature, often studying from when he got home from work to the early hours of the morning.

His persistence paid off when he landed a job at Consensys and took charge of the Ethereal Summits. Within a short space of time he had journeyed from being a bewildered attendant at the conference to its organiser.

Now the host of Yield TV and a core member of Zapper, DeFi Dad’s meteoric rise mirrors that of the DeFi world. Somehow, through all of this, the Dad of DeFi still finds the time to be a Dad at home.

Here’s his story, in High Definition.
</h2><p>JACK: All right, thank you so much for coming Defi dad on high definition, it&#x27;s pleasure to have you here, would you be able just to start off by telling us a little bit about yourself and your background?
 
DEFI DAD: Absolutely. And let me know if I, if I go back far enough, because I want to, I want to share, I think the origin of some of the skills I actually use today, which weirdly connect back to even like going back to college. So I would say, speaking at a high level in terms of like where I&#x27;m from, I&#x27;m from a very like, middle of the country of the United States. I, I grew up in a very middle class home. Money was never an issue. But we were not wealthy. I thought we were because growing up middle class in the United States in the 90s, especially, you felt rich, like you live the same life as everyone else. We had great public schools, we all lived in nice houses in the area that I lived in, which again, like think of like the Midwest, of the United States. And I mean, my, I had like a very awesome sort of childhood, like, so I was, I was very lucky, I always was a good student in school, always enjoyed learning, which is something that, like, it&#x27;s a characteristic that clearly defines who I am today. It&#x27;s just weird, because it was more of like, I just want to learn for the sake of making mom and dad happy at that point in my life. But now, of course, I&#x27;ve more discovered, like the joy of learning for myself. So it&#x27;s a little more selfish, I think now, but I ended up going to, I would say a very prestigious school in the in the US, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s definitely ranked top five most days. And that school that I went to, I studied chemistry. And so my background really was I continued this sort of like learning for the sake of making mom and dad happy being like the type A personality in school, and I got to college, and I just got burned by all of the brilliant people around me. I mean, I realized, I&#x27;m really not that smart. I&#x27;m really, I mean, maybe in the grand spectrum of humanity, sure. But, but the people around me just blew me away and sort of like knocked my ego down a peg. And I ended up getting to the end of university, and I wanted to go into medicine. And then I ended up discovering that I really enjoyed chemistry. And I had a awesome mentor who sort of led me to a Chem Ph. D program. So you know, long story short, by the time I graduated, I was a very subpar chemistry student, but at a really good school, felt like I was the shittiest chemistry student in the world knew that I was good at solving problems. I had a lot of salesman, salesman skills that I had developed over the years because I have worked in my family&#x27;s small business growing up. So I have like these two different lives sort of juxtaposed against one another where I&#x27;m in a lab, I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m in this like very, like high academic institution, sort of like environment learning. And then I&#x27;ve got this like, small business mentality where I&#x27;m selling, you know, electronics to people over the counter and having conversations with them and just, I don&#x27;t know, finding a lot of joy in that. And it&#x27;s, I only point this out in the early days because it&#x27;s weird. I think the skills I developed working from the time I was I mean, I was in kinder garten and was like helping my father in this small business. By the time I was in high school selling, you know, electronics over the counter to folks, those skills I think have served me better than anything I&#x27;ve ever learned in all that, you know, the calculus classes I took and all the other bullshit I learned in quantum mechanics and crap like that. So if you fast forward, then I ended up in this Chem PhD program. So I moved from the Midwest to the west coast, did a lot of growing up over a few years, actually had a lot of joy in joining this, this chem PhD. But within a few years, while I was teaching chemistry, I was discovering again, that I kept going down this path of kind of like trying to force myself into like a like a square peg into a round hole, I wanted to suddenly be a professor. But I didn&#x27;t really want to be a professor, I wanted to do research, but I didn&#x27;t really want to do research. But I was enjoying the learning behind it. And I actually had my greatest joy was teaching, I was trying to keep teach chemistry to students that were like me, because I felt like no one, no one really was helping me when I was in university, no one was really like giving me that confidence that I could like, get through these incredibly challenging classes. So I took the, the opposite approach, I was very nurturing to my students, and just really trying to like, help them through and not get overwhelmed. Which again, weirdly enough, I would say that skill stat is part of I think, what has like helped me to accelerate in the last few years working in deep phi. So anyways, I get to the end of two years in grad school, I pass this very, there&#x27;s this like, oral exam that you take three professors sort of like, sit there and ask you a bunch of hard questions. It&#x27;s, um, it&#x27;s known for making lots of students cry, students are normally like, 22 to 30, depends on how old they are starting the program. And I finished this, and I passed it, which was like a miracle to me. And then I quit, almost like weeks after I was like, I just don&#x27;t belong here. Like I love chemistry, I love the learning. But I will never ever succeed as an outlier in this space. And that was a lesson along the way too, about like kind of recognizing your skill set. Just because people tell you you&#x27;re doing something right and might he might not be in the right place. So then, I started to finally work in software startups. And it was, of course, starting with like my own idea, thinking that maybe I could raise money. We lived on the west coast, not in the Bay Area. So that was not that easy. And my like arrogant, 24 year old ego like thought, Oh, hey, I&#x27;ll be able to do this, I&#x27;ll be able to raise money, even though I don&#x27;t live in Silicon Valley. And after about six months, I burned through what little money I had. So the chemistry PhD had paid me to be there. Like all physical sciences programs, you get paid to be there, you get paid very little, but still, you&#x27;re paid. So you&#x27;re not having to pay your tuition. So I burned through my money. And I started of all things a cookie bakery, started doing it, it was just to pay the bills, it was to like, basically make ends meet because I really felt strongly about the different. At that point, there was one software startup that I was working on, I felt really strongly about it thought we had a great idea. Started to Yeah, like sell cookies locally. We were selling them until as like a catering business but also as like a late night delivery. And these were they weren&#x27;t we&#x27;d cookies, which it kind of sounds like that when I describe it. And it was, it was the best and worst experience up until that point in my life. I was I grew it to about 20 part time employees over the course of three years. I got to the point where we were even drawing up plans thinking about like trying to open up a chain of these because it was very popular with the universities where we lived. There was a lot of demand a lot of outreach for like, people wanting to franchise it. And like again, I like realized man like this, there is like no joy in this anymore. I mean, I&#x27;m working really hard. I&#x27;m barely making ends meet. I had a few mentors I was lucky to have at the time who worked in fast food chains. These were the owners of fast food chains. They had scaled them. One of them was worth hundreds of Mills. Billions of dollars. And this guy had been at it for 30 40 years. And I just kind of looked at his life and was like, I there&#x27;s no way that I am going to keep the relationship I have, which eventually turned into my marriage. So, so I had met my wife during this, and she was putting up with that. And then we were, of course, thinking about, eventually we would have kids, and I was thinking about how I would handle all of that. So I guess the key take-away from that part of my life, right before I go to the Bay Area is, again, there&#x27;s this theme of having conversations with people taking a genuine interest in what they have to say, being just fascinated with people. When I would travel, especially on airplanes, I carried a journal with me and I would just meet random people. And I would write, you know, journal entries about them. And I, I would unintentionally interview them, just because I was so fascinated by how people&#x27;s stories were so unique. But then, like, how there was this commonality that you would find, I think, you know, I ended up throwing that journal out, I always thought I would like keep that that it would be like some sort of awesome keepsake to show someone later. But again, that is a skill set that now I&#x27;m like, okay, so part of the reason I&#x27;m doing what I do is because I love talking to anyone about defi, and I love learning from them about what they&#x27;re thinking whether they have $1 in their wallet, or whether they have a million dollars. So then fast forward a few more years, we moved to the Bay Area, I&#x27;m finally close to getting into crypto here. I have ignored it up until this point in my life and Bitcoin has been born at this point. I actually had someone offered to pay me in cookies years before with Bitcoin. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was like 2011. So if you go back and you think about however much a cookie order, like a 30 $50 cookie order would be. I mean, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like the order. Oh, that&#x27;s a couple.
 
JACK: That&#x27;s a couple that&#x27;s a couple.
 
DEFI DAD:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s a, that&#x27;s a few kids, university tuitions, and probably a house or two. But I ended up in the Bay Area finally. And I started to find this groove with working with Silicon Valley, you know, companies. I worked with a marketing research company for a bit and I got to work with some really reputable names like box and Salesforce and Dropbox. And I was working with them in an advisory capacity, kind of learning what the sales marketing product leaders were doing in those companies. And then I gotta say, like, in retrospect, I didn&#x27;t realize it then. I mean, I was actually really loving my job at this point. But what they did at those companies I found to be so boring, the mission I thought was boring. What they did as Jobs was fascinating to me, because, I mean, you know, good God, if you look at like the way they scale sales.
 
JACK: What was the mission?
 
DEFI DAD: Like to automate to automate the process of you know, collecting sales data and contact information and make revenue predictable? Like, I mean, I&#x27;m sure it was cool in the early days, but like, at this point, yeah, it was like this is business to business relationships. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re gonna affect millions and millions and millions of lives but they&#x27;re not gonna be able to affect what like a Bitcoin and ethereum a chain link what whatever everything that we see in like, DEFI So anyways, I&#x27;m bulldoze through a bunch of startups. I lived the, you know, the typical Silicon Valley startup experience. Most of them were just absolute shit storms, I mean, just, you know, quick experiences, learned a lot worked with a lot of volatile personalities. And in 2017, so it was the summertime. And I had a friend, thankfully at one of these startups who said, you know, hey, you know, you would really like this thing called the Ethereum. I remember specifically repeating it, I was like, Ethereum. What did you say? Is that even like a word, and then he showed me a video of VITALIK and I was like, is this guy even real? Like, because the words even like decentralization and all of all of the typical buzzwords that you use, up to that point, it was so difficult. It was so difficult to find anyone who could explain to me what is a ethereum for but I ran into bitcoin as well and I think Bitcoin at that point by like, August 2017 you know, everything was going up in price. And I was digging into podcasts and reading the white papers that were out there and stuff like that and, and was like, finally, like realizing like holy cow like this. This is something that this is something that really feels like it could change the world. And this feels like something that has economic upside, it feels like something that it&#x27;s not going to just help the rich, it&#x27;s not gonna, It&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t help the rich to get the momentum going so that you can truly make it like a globalized technology. It just checked off all these boxes that I had never really thought about. And then I ended up going to an ethereal conference. And I think it was October 2017. I like to think I&#x27;m the only person who paid a full price ticket. Probably everyone was there for free because they had a friend, you know, who worked at consensus are one of the other companies that was there. But I went there on my own. I basically lived like the fantasy of fantasies that I had over all these years, which was, I talked about really complex problems with people that reminded me of chemistry. I got to have engaging conversations. I got to learn from people the entire day. I mean, I kept a little note in my phone, I was literally typing people&#x27;s names in and trying to write down like what they did. And it&#x27;s too bad. I should have kept the note original because my original thoughts were so funny to read. I clearly I didn&#x27;t understand what anything was, but I was trying to make sense of decentralized. You know, like, what is a decentralized blockchain? And yeah, I got to the end of the day, and I would say like, that was a major inflection point in my life. I mean, I came home, I was already deep down the crypto rabbit hole. My wife knew this, I was putting our son to bed. So we had a baby who was just a year old. And I was putting him to bed every night and literally staying in his room for hours because I was listening to podcasts and reading. So base, I would get home from work and I would just read from the time I got home until God knows what one or 2 am I barely had any crypto at this point to I mean, I bought a tiny bit of Bitcoin, a little bit of ether. And I just was obsessed as like the most like jittery, exciting feeling. Which I think I still have today actually. But it was, it was like, I think I have found the thing I want to focus on for the rest of my life.
 
JACK: I liked the idea of helping people through hard challenges. And that&#x27;s probably a reason why you&#x27;ve got your TV, which is basically a platform which simplifies the complexities of a ethereum and defi. But do you think there&#x27;s an argument to be made that nurturing and helping people into something that is complex? Actually inhibits their ability to learn?
 
DEFI DAD: Yeah, do you do you mean to say they might struggle to be on boarded because of being helped too much? Or like I would be burned out from from too much effort?
 
JACK: No, the newcomer to ethereum.
 
DEFI DAD: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, that that&#x27;s a great point, okay, so, crypto in general. So we&#x27;re thinking like someone who&#x27;s simply holding Bitcoin to someone who is yield farming with defi it clearly takes some curiosity. It takes some initiative to learn and to you know, to work at it to have the bravery to click Confirm on meta mask, I mean, that that is definitely something that I don&#x27;t take lightly. I still remember the first time I use meta mask, I was like, This all has to be like a joke. I&#x27;m clearly like playing into like a Ponzi at this point. But yeah, I, I think what I have found really challenging, though, in like a very fulfilling way is I am trying to think every second of every day about what is the minimal amount of information that someone needs in order to have a light bulb moment that will drive them to keep learning and what is the minimal amount of information we can provide for them to actually get started with defi with crypto in general, you know, even if it just means someone again, holding some ether in their wallet. So it&#x27;s a weird sort of thing. Like you can&#x27;t expect the world to be the way that many of the people we know on our lives to be in crypto where, you know, in the defi community, it&#x27;s filled with self-learners, people who enjoy tinkering, but will never see mass adoption if  that is required at every level. Everyone cannot be a Thinker. And I think like, without drawing too many parallels to it I, I do take some inspiration from, you know, the usual places like when you look at the, you know, the mass adoption of personal computers, and you look at smartphones, and you look at the Internet, and you say, on day one, were less tech savvy people using this, this technology. No, they clearly were not using it. It took, you know, people who were brave enough to try it. And then to evangelize it. What I find most fulfilling about that is just that no matter how much progress we make, I am never satisfied with I&#x27;m never satisfied with any of the milestones. I mean, defi at 1 billion was huge. And I just immediately started thinking, when do we get to 10? Then we hit 10. And I was like, well, we got to go to 20. And actually, in all honesty, I remember at 10 thinking, we&#x27;re gonna hit 20, shortly, we got to get to 50. And now we&#x27;re above 30. And I&#x27;m already thinking like, I can&#x27;t wait till we hit 100 billion. So that, to me is a part of that&#x27;s a part of what makes the community so special right now is I think that people derive a lot of joy from the work that is done, but are constantly hungry for that much more pushing, pushing the milestone markers further and further along.
DAVID: Yeah. And I do want to return to sort of where you were. So you know, here you are, you&#x27;re putting your kids to bed and sort of learning as much as you can about this industry that you&#x27;ve falling head over heels with what happens next?
 
DEFI DAD: Yes, so yeah, I came home. And I remember distinctly, you know, talking to my wife about like, I don&#x27;t know when this will happen, but I like really want to work in crypto. And at the time, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was related to Bitcoin or ethereum or defi wasn&#x27;t even like a term at that time. But I also had a one year old child. So I do remember I like I definitely sort of shielded her from like, my real enthusiasm, like I was like, yeah, so this is something I want to be really involved with, you know, because we have a child now. And that&#x27;s obviously my first priority and responsibility. But by January, I was proactively reaching out to recruiters, you know, basically asking, I want to work for a company in the crypto space.I somehow started to zero in on Ethereum. Like I knew that I wanted to work on ethereum at that point, but I can&#x27;t remember what pushed me away from Bitcoin, maybe it was just I didn&#x27;t see as many opportunities. Because I was equally as obsessed with both ethereum and Bitcoin at this point. I do remember, recruiters, you know, their job is just to get you recruited. So they can get paid and they had. So you have to keep in mind at this point, given my age, and my rank in this company that I was working for, I was on a team of like 20 sales people, it had grown from three to 20. And I had like, kind of like, taken up like a spiritual leadership on the team. I wasn&#x27;t like the head of sales or anything. But it was it was it&#x27;s a path a lot of people take you are a leader on the team, then you become a manager, then you become like a director like a head of sales. So recruiters are slinging these really great opportunities at me. And I am like, I am rejecting all of it, like won&#x27;t even have an interview. I&#x27;m like, I don&#x27;t want to talk unless the company works on ethereum. I only want to work in the crypto space. I don&#x27;t and and when we&#x27;re talking about that, like I&#x27;m willing to work on anything. I don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m a project manager, a salesperson, which seemed ridiculous. At that point. There weren&#x27;t any sales people needed in the crypto space, unless you&#x27;re talking about the enterprise blockchain. And I started I kept going to meetups and then I finally got ahold of a recruiter at consensus because Laura Shin of unchained. I had met her at a conference. And I was so blown away by the content she was creating. I thought she was I still would say that she was like one of the she was one of the main inspirations for me wanting to go work in now defi but in crypto ethereum and Laura was so kind and was like, you know, let me give you a few recommendations of places to go. We even talked about Actually, I forget about this. Laura helped me not just because I was nice to her, and because I like engaged her at a conference, it was because I offered to help her for free, because I was so hungry and desperate to want to work in ethereum or crypto. And I had said, seriously, like, Whatever you need, I felt like I owed her like, basically I felt like my life had taken like a great turning point. It was all due to her. So I, I did nothing more than I helped her set up like a CRM because she was, you know, doing lots of advertising. And she was really starting to like, she was already a huge deal in our space. But she was, you know, really getting lots of advertisers reaching out. I did that. I mean, he talked about like, the simplest bit of effort, it probably took me an hour, it was something I was very accustomed to doing. I showed her it. And I mean, we just had a really warm relationship from there. And she was always very gracious with her time and would respond to me about nothing questions that I had. And that was it. I started anyways, I got a referral to consensus. And it took me three months with consensus to get the job, I basically had to email a recruiter every week, he was one of the worst recruiters I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Just the guy probably couldn&#x27;t spell his last name if he didn&#x27;t have like a note in front of them. Just a complete idiot. So and I&#x27;m a nice person so that it&#x27;s he said a benchmark and being a crappy recruiter. So I ended up finally getting the job. After literally project managing my like hiring process, I was like, almost like guiding them through like, Oh, so would you like me to meet with this person next, because I looked on LinkedIn. And I can see that this person is there. So I finally get this job. I joined the marketing team at consensus. And I worked with a team of about it was about 50 to 60 people. It was a wonderful team, I had this wonderful boss, who was the CMO at the time, Amanda Gutterman, who&#x27;s now Amanda Cassidy, I just had this like lovely experience for two years. Amanda was just this, she was just this like very nurturing like leader to everyone on the team. She was very passionate about everything in in ethereum. I mean, we lived through, I joined in the summer of 2018. So the markets had already like, you know, gone down, like close to 50% from all-time highs. But everyone had this like hope that it wasn&#x27;t, you know, that we weren&#x27;t going to continue downwards. And then the market hit bottom by December. So I&#x27;ve been there six months, I watched, I think it was 15% of the company got laid off. And I like I still loved working. I just was like this is awesome. Like, I mean, not the layoffs,that was terrible. But I was like, it&#x27;s so awesome to finally be at like the heart of ethereum at the heart of crypto and, you know, consensus worked on a lot of projects. So I was kind of I had this I was very fortunate, like I got to interface with a lot of people, you know, including like very sparing interactions with like meta mask and kind of just being an off like holy cow. Like these guys. No doubt, Dan Finley and meta mask are still you know what one of the one of the most important projects and ethereum, truffle, bitcoin as well, Kevin kawaki I&#x27;ve gotten introduced to and kind of was inspired by the work he was doing. So I worked there two years, but in my last year, so I worked there for basically six to nine months. And then ETHEREAL, which was put on by consensus. Funny enough, here&#x27;s the event I had gone to I had skipped work paid $600 to go to it. And it turned out that this project manager on the team, she had gotten a job elsewhere and decided she was going to leave and I had this amazing opportunity to fill in. And so here it is full circle. Now I&#x27;m working on ethereal, which is the event that to me was kind of an inflection point in my life. You know of like holy cow like this is it like I want to work on this forever. And I got to spend the next basically the next little over a year working on these, you know conferences, which would normally happen during New York blockchain week. But we also went to Tel Aviv and then we ended up doing a virtual conference. Because in 2020, the pandemic happen, of course, so I got to just really like have this like joyous ride working on storytelling, which is why I love what you guys are doing with this podcast, and yeah, one of one of the best jobs to I&#x27;ve ever had, I mean, just it&#x27;s so much fun to work on that storytelling. And you know, definitely like a credit to Joe Lubin was very generous with supporting ethereal, it was, it was the creation of Amanda, and a number of others on the team, before I ever joined. But I mean, man, they love, they love ethereal, I love ethereal. And that that leads to really now which is by the summertime. So during ethereal, what&#x27;s happening is when I&#x27;m working on a cereal in the summer of 2019. So I have this background of literally spending every waking hour of the day giving demos in software, selling people on software, having, you know, customer support, with me to customize some pretty complex software that had 1000s of variables, and you would like map out business processes very similar to Salesforce. So that&#x27;s a skill set. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll never probably use in the near future with ethereum because there were just no apps that were alive at that point. I mean, everything was so archaic and augur was one of the few things but it wasn&#x27;t, it was so hard to use. So summer of 2019, maker had about 500 million in total value locked, which was pretty remarkable. Compound now had 50 million. And I started using compound I just, I don&#x27;t know what it was, but I was planning for ethereal in the fall. And I thought, it&#x27;s so stupid that I&#x27;m setting up like these, these lineups and these narratives to play out throughout the event. I should really like explore some of these applications. I should like try them. Again, I was blind to like, other than maker, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure of anything that was working very well. I got Yeah, I started using compound. And I remember I lent like 10 DAI. And like my mind was blown. I just was like, this is so radical. Wait a sec. So I just lent 10 dye and at that time, I think it was earning like 20%. And then my mind started to like, do the thing we all do in crypto and like if I put X amount of money, yeah, I would make this much. Except this time it made sense. It wasn&#x27;t like, if I put in $1,000 and it goes up just 1000 x I&#x27;ll be a millionaire. Which is that&#x27;s that was the 2017 mentality. This was different. It was like this is a very like reasonable understandable mechanism. We are lending and others are borrowing. It&#x27;s all verifiable. On the blockchain, I can see it an ether scan, I can verify how much money they have. I&#x27;m protected from credit risk, because if someone doesn&#x27;t maintain their loan, they&#x27;re just going to liquidate them anyways. I&#x27;m like, this is awesome. So I played with that I played with pool together. I played with token sets, token sets just at that point blew me away because I thought it was so cool that they automated trading strategies. And I saw it like this is a trading bot that lives on smart contracts. And like this is crazy powerful. And the fact that I could tell friends about it, like, hey, there&#x27;s this thing, it&#x27;s like a trading bot, but it runs on ethereum Hey, there&#x27;s this thing you can lend and borrow. And it runs on ethereum Oh, what&#x27;s so special about it one earning it was like again 20% on DAI, which even my father in law who&#x27;s older and you know, pretty tech savvy, but not you know, couldn&#x27;t give a shit normally about Ethereum was like what? You can earn 20% on dollars. And I&#x27;m like, Yeah, yeah, it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all real. It works. I mean, I can show you how. So I started tweeting more aggressively about all this stuff. Like I went from like, I went from the thesis that I developed over that summer was that ethereum namely defi was already usable, and that the world was talking about it like it wasn&#x27;t usable. Like we had many decades to wait until well, you know, web three isn&#x27;t usable. Ethereum needs a better UX. And I was like, I don&#x27;t think that this is hard to use, hardest part is whether you can manage to use like a meta mask or some other you know, ethereum wallet, which I recognize some challenges there at the time. But I&#x27;m like, I mean to earn 20% is pretty insane to earn. 10% on digital dollars is pretty insane. And by the time we got to September, which was when ethereal happened, I had played with zerion at the time I had so I had started to manage my portfolio with zerion. I invited them to ethereal. I had gotten to know Kiber network pretty well, understanding how important they were for sourcing liquidity hold together was just fun, because I told people, you know, it&#x27;s a lottery where you can&#x27;t lose, it&#x27;s like going to the gas station, buying a ticket, coming home, playing the lottery consecutively for as many weeks as you want. And when you&#x27;re like, you know what I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m not going to win, this is stupid, you go back to the gas station, you return it, and they you know, they give you all your money back. And so all these stories were starting to play out in my head. And I was tweeting very short tutorials, typical sort of like emojis like 1234, here&#x27;s what you do. And I was noticing that, I mean, even if I was getting just a few likes that I was helping lots of people, people were sending me messages. And I didn&#x27;t know if they had $1. I didn&#x27;t know if they had millions, I definitely actually met a few early on who had millions. And it was funny, they were asking me and I was giving them all this help. And I remember thinking like, I wish they would pay me like a little fee, because like, it seems kind of ridiculous that I&#x27;m like advising them and I really don&#x27;t have that much money. But I guess so. This all ties back then to earlier in my life. Like I was approaching all of this the way I would have whether I was selling electronics at a small family business, whether I was you know, working in the lab with some really brilliant folks, you know, trying to do chemistry experiments I was, I was, you know, explaining every nuance to the people that would reach out to me, which I would still argue I still do, it&#x27;s just harder to get to all of those messages. And finding that like, hey, like my ability to have taught chemistry, it&#x27;s like, really helping me now like I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m using all the same tactics. And I&#x27;m making it very visual, everything I was doing was like, very visual, it was normally me like showing screenshots, putting, like, you know, just simple things, throw it into like a slide and put like arrows and point and make sure that it&#x27;s so dummy proof that no one could possibly screw it up. And by the time the winter hit, I mean, I it was we were close to 1 billion in total value locked and, and I just, I felt like, like, this is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever known something before other people. And I&#x27;m like watching it play out in front of me like, like holy cow, like people really don&#x27;t know, they&#x27;re like under estimating that we&#x27;re gonna hit a billion very soon. And my thinking at that time was, I think we are going to hit a billion and we&#x27;re gonna go to 10 billion very shortly after people just don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s harder to get to that that first milestone because just because of the network effects that happen. And yeah, I mean, just 2020 I like I would just sum it up. As you know, I lived two lives. One was working on ethereal, which was wonderful. And I was enjoying that with consensus. But every last minute outside of that I was focused on every new defi app that would come out, it was my goal to make a video as quickly as possible about it. I started to make videos in late May, mid to late May of 2020, which was really stepping things up going from like Twitter posts with simple instructions and screenshots to I&#x27;m going to make a full blown tutorial, I&#x27;m going to edit it, you know, if  I&#x27;m gonna make something that is probably not the best looking but it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s going to be easy to follow. And I would joke that it was it looked like a boomer got a hold of an iMovie or something like that. It was it was, you know, clearly not the best editing in the world. But it didn&#x27;t matter because people just were so grateful because they had no other resource at that point. And by the end of the summer, I mean, gosh, I had like gotten to know zapper really well, I mean, I was kind of living through all the mania that everyone saw happened during the summer. And just thinking like, this is only the beginning. Like this is not a new, we&#x27;re not in like a new bubble where we&#x27;re gonna draw down 90% we&#x27;re just in a little micro bubble of you know, stupidity, issuing worthless governance tokens, even though they were not awesome projects like yorne had launched, curve had already launched and issued a governance token, and then you have compound. So there was all sorts of quality there. But yeah, we got to the end of the summer. And I&#x27;m actually I&#x27;ll pause there for a sec, but I can tell you about how we got started at zapper and all that.
 
JACK: Well, I&#x27;m interested to keep going there. Because I think the zapper and yield TV part of the story is super interesting. And then you also becoming a community lead of some sort on Twitter.
 
DEFI DAD: Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, there were, you know, a few other things I like left out that were happening along the way as I started making the ethereal podcast, that was so this all starts in the pandemic. Pandemic kicks off. I&#x27;ve never recorded a podcast, I&#x27;ve never done a video. So um,so the pandemic, at least in the United States got really rough around March. So March 2020. We&#x27;re all now, you know, stuck inside, like the rest of the world. And, yeah, I had never recorded a podcast and I had never actually made a video and I had also never been in virtual reality. I had not bought a headset, like an Oculus headset. I&#x27;d never touched anything like crypto voxels. All these things happen at once. We were getting ready for ethereal which pivoted to a virtual conference in the spring. And I got introduced, because of the Twitter posts. I was making someone reached out and said, like, you know, you should explore. You should explore crypto voxels. And the token smart community had a number of people on their team who just were really cool, guys. I mean, it was Rizal and Jimmy. And then Matthew from cent, who works at cent but also is in the crypto voxels community and token smart. I mean, it was like a renaissance to me 2020 I feel terribly how rough it&#x27;s been for so many but like for me like I discovered virtual reality and how like how much I loved it how interesting the metaverse is and how it ties into to defi to digital finance to native digital finance that can power the metaverse and, and NFT&#x27;s I finally understood like, Oh, this is why people love NFT&#x27;s because when you live in a native digital space, digital collectibles become that much more interesting and valuable to you. And by the time we had what hit the summer, I recorded like I think 15 ethereal podcasts, which are still all up but that was like that was definitely a passion project that went along with ethereal. I was I was making videos finally, and I was meeting all these teams and a lot of teams. I mean, still to this day, a lot of defi teams struggle to make resources that teach users, you know, beginners and advanced how to use it. I think we&#x27;ve come a long way. And I&#x27;d like to think like I&#x27;ve had some sort of impact there. There&#x27;s actually there&#x27;s a number of incredibly talented educators or educational content creators now in our space, too. So by the time I had hit, like I said, maybe August or something I was, you know, pretty close. In terms of contact with zapper I just thought zapper and zerion as well, I thought both teams and a few others were poised to be like the ultimate on ramps for defi. And I still think that too. I work at zapper but much love to my friends at zerion. And I yeah, I got got to August in one of the co-founders basically said, Hey, like, you know, we&#x27;re growing at a crazy rate like, we&#x27;d love to have you join. The problem is that I was moving cross country. So I&#x27;m moving from California to the east coast at that point. I&#x27;ve got two kids. We&#x27;re thinking eventually about buying a house. I mean, it is like the most stressful time of my life. We were packing up everything in our home, which is a complete nightmare. And, you know, there&#x27;s the pandemic. We&#x27;re prepping just to fly with two kids and a dog which is like ridiculous, like, try flying during the pandemic. Try flying with like a dog into kids. It&#x27;s even worse. A Friday before we were moving literally. We were Leaving on Saturday. I think it was Friday, Zappar reached out and had said, Hey, you know, you know, we really appreciate all the content you&#x27;ve always done for us. You know, why don&#x27;t you join the team, like we&#x27;re not. And at the time, too, they were, they were like, we&#x27;re not really sure what exactly that title or role is. But it&#x27;s just, you know, the team at that point was like five or six people. And it was like, we need help with everything operations, marketing, support, just being in discord and supporting people with the knowledge that, you know, hey, I can help you with, with the troubles you&#x27;re having in zapper. I mean, it was it, it was definitely an offer that like it appealed to me, but it was like, I now have two children and we&#x27;re moving. And this all seems like a bit abrupt. And I thought about it I think for like, less than 24 hours and came back and was like hell yes. I want to I absolutely want to like this is all I want to work on. You know, I want to work on defi full time and ethereal was wonderful consensus was great to me, but just wanted to work full time on like, what was like my truest passion there. So you know, it&#x27;s like all these dots makes sense to me now, as I&#x27;m like, looking back and connecting them. But now at zapper, I tend to focus on a few things. So I am a member of the core team of zapper, I don&#x27;t think that the titles really matter. But we do joke around and actually state that my title is chief defi officer. So we, I tend to focus on, of course, understanding from users how we can make the product better, but that goes hand in hand with just living in our discord, which I would say a number of us on the team in between all the other things that we work on discord is one of the most important tools in crypto and defi right now. You get to interact with you get your users who come to you and give you every last bit of good and bad feedback. But you get this wide spectrum of users, both beginners and advanced who are asking, you know, the most important questions and I love it. I absolutely love it. It is chaos in our discord at all times. I mean, it&#x27;s just an I mean, I&#x27;ve heard discord go off while we&#x27;ve been recording here, and I&#x27;m going to be I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll come back to like a firestorm. But it reminds me also of all the customer service still, that is like in my background, like I spent so much time when I had a cookie business, I spent so much time in my father, my uncle&#x27;s small family business, I spent a lot of time you know, just helping people, people that are sometimes very polite and people sometimes who are very angry and pissed off and rude, just a rarity and zapper but there&#x27;s the person occasionally who burns through like point five ether and gas and their transaction gets reverted. And they come to you like what the hell just happened. I just lost like $500 you know, because they tried to trade when the markets were really volatile, and they put in a low gas price and it got rejected by uniswap. So  there&#x27;s all of that the thing I love the most about working at zapper now is I focus on yield TV. So multiple times a week we host live streams. Normally it&#x27;s Monday and Wednesday minimally but tends to be Tuesdays and Thursdays to every Monday we do defi class, we cover basics to fundamentals on all sorts of topics. We&#x27;ll do like a class on how to master gas prices. We&#x27;ve done how to get started yield farming, and today we did one on defi indexes. So that is like the ultimate joy. That&#x27;s what I was doing. You know, making videos as like a defi educator. But then we get to interview founders and we screen share with them every single yield TV, we do tons of screen sharing. There&#x27;s only a few episodes where we haven&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s normally with investors. But everyone else we live. We show everything live and like I&#x27;m normally asking like pretty genuine questions that I&#x27;m kind of puzzled by myself as we&#x27;re navigating it.
 
JACK: It&#x27;s crazy to see how enthusiastic you are about the space. And I guess just to play back into what you said before, about burnout, that you were nowhere near it. Does that start to impact your family life? What do they think about this? And do you still have time to be a dad outside of defi Dad?
 
DEFI DAD: Yeah, it is. It&#x27;s definitely challenging. I would say it comes in ebbs and waves like what happens is I will go through a period of clearly pushing boundaries like, you know, let&#x27;s pretend if I did like a podcast multiple nights in a row, I know better than to do that now doing one a week, no problem. If I did multiple like, like, Hey, I got to go on, there&#x27;s a clubhouse talk, I need to join or there&#x27;s someone in Singapore, who wants to be on yield TV and like we&#x27;re gonna do it late at night. So I&#x27;ve kind of figured out some of those. Those ways that I&#x27;ve pushed boundaries. I do have I think, like, weekend&#x27;s I&#x27;m really good about sort of tuning out, I still track things on Twitter. And I&#x27;m still always like, I mean, my phone is always at my side. But I Yeah, I definitely like I think about, like, what you&#x27;re saying, I think about this, because I talk with a lot of other friends who have kids, and we talk about the fact that it&#x27;s like, your kids are only a little so long, and you really have to, like enjoy that. But then we&#x27;re also sort of living through this remarkable, you know, revolution with money, Legos and defi. And so I don&#x27;t know, I, I have tried to just be present when I can, you know, be as present as possible, like when I&#x27;m with my family. But I mean, my wife could tell you, I, I screw that up all the time. So if it comes again, there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s like weeks where I&#x27;m like, I&#x27;m doing really well. And then there&#x27;s weeks where I start to revert back to bad habits.
 
JACK: What are the bad habits look like?
 
DEFI DAD: Oh, like, I&#x27;m kind of like what I was saying. It would be like being there with your kids. But I&#x27;m like, staring at my phone because I&#x27;m like staring at you know, God knows what, with some new defi app, or maybe I&#x27;m even trying to listen to I have done this before where I&#x27;ve like, tried to listen into a clubhouse talk. And like, my kids are like sleeping on either side of me. I&#x27;m like trying to put them to bed. It&#x27;s kind of ridiculous. And then someone calls upon me this happened once I was in clubhouse, and someone called upon me and I was like, Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Sorry. Give me just a sec here. And pretend like I&#x27;m not like laying on my back with like, two little human beings cuddled next to me. Yeah, I think it comes down to like a presence thing, though. So I&#x27;m like, I think the fact that I&#x27;m conscious of it, though, is like a good thing. I think if I think the minute you&#x27;re the minute that you think that you&#x27;re doing enough, you&#x27;re in a pretty bad place, then you&#x27;re probably gonna get yourself in trouble with a with a partner. But all of my friends that are in this space kind of describe it the same way both men and women to like a number of women friends that I have in this space have said that their husbands are like, Good God, like Do you guys ever just turn off? Anything? You know, the answer is? No. Because it&#x27;s, it is 24 seven. So, zapper though I will say this, if anyone is looking to work in this space, it is possible to have that normal support system. I would say zapper my team is incredibly supportive and respectful of like my time with family. They wouldn&#x27;t bother me on a weekend. But I would say like, I&#x27;m pretty good friends with everyone on the team by now. So we&#x27;re kind of like checking in like, Hey, man, what are you doing? You know, did you see such and such went up in price, things like that. So yeah, so I don&#x27;t want to scare people away from working here. I&#x27;ve actually gotten someone recently I got I helped to get hired. That was a friend of mine. She is a mother and I think she found a great team. I think the team is the team has a great work culture and I think they&#x27;ll be very supportive of like her being both a mother and also someone that works with them.
 
JACK: Which team is that?
 
DEFI DAD: Nexus actually Yeah, my friend Kendria got hired by Nexus mutual as a community lead Yeah, pretty, pretty awesome role. So another person who just was tweeting kendria someone I met because she was tweeting about God knows what and defy and I just thought that she had like really, really awesome like ideas and we started to sort of message and like answered questions here and there for her and she would reach out actually with awesome ideas was so I was learning from her as well. And there it is, you know I&#x27;ve never met her in person only talked through Twitter and then got to know her by you know, actually like reaching out and saying, hey, like what jobs are you applying to? Now she&#x27;s got a job. It&#x27;s pretty amazing.
 
DAVID: And I guess on a final note, where can people go and find you?
 
DEFIDAD: Yeah, so there&#x27;s a few places most obvious is if you look up at defi underscore dad on Twitter, Everything every thought about defy try to post through there. It&#x27;s really to just it&#x27;s more of like a stream of thoughts to help people with defi, I still think like, basically 24 seven about like, if I were new, what would I want to know? So some of the topics are advanced, but I really do try to talk about more basic fundamentals like even gas prices. Another thing is what you guys mentioned earlier, if you go to TV dot zapper dot phi, or if you follow yield underscore TV, that&#x27;s the place that you can watch live streams, those happen multiple times a week. So those are like defi classes to defi demonstrations. And that&#x27;s all powered by produced by zapper. So that&#x27;s a part of the work I do at zapper. And then the last place you got to defi dad dot com, that&#x27;ll just redirect you to my YouTube channel, I tend to post more into yield TV now just because I literally doing shows there four or five times a week maybe. And so I would say that&#x27;s the best place to be learning like off the cuff about all the new defi material. If you are brand new though to defi, and you are a crypto native. So at defi dad dot com, there&#x27;s a playlist that&#x27;s defi for beginners. That one is perfect for anyone who&#x27;s who is a crypto native, but just wants to learn defi , enter into that. If you search DEFI 101, which is on the defiant YouTube channel, that is a web series with 30. That&#x27;s 30 episodes that we collaborated to produce so I wrote them in the defiant produce them. We made that as a public good over the last six months. So that is to me like if you&#x27;re new and you just want to know the basics, but don&#x27;t want to get your hands dirty, defi 101 on the defiant news channel. And then if you&#x27;re ready to actually get your hands dirty, that&#x27;s where defi dad dot com becomes powerful. And that&#x27;s it.
 
DAVID: Right. Great. Well, they find that thanks very much for your time.
 
DEFI DAD: Thanks for having me, guys. This is great. Thank you so much.
