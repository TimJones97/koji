Aaron has certainly spoken to a lot of people throughout his journey.

Those conversations began on the streets of New Jersey during a working-class upbringing. Shovelling snow and delivering pizza gave Aaron the spare change he wanted and the ox-like work ethic he needed to play ball with some of the great minds in the tech space.

After graduating law school and successfully building and selling his first venture, Aaron’s conversations took him deep into the DeFi world. He was at the early Bitcoin meetups, usually hosted in dingy backrooms of New York Chinatown and was instrumental in Ethereum’s early days.

He loves history, economics, law and technology. Topics many find dry, but magnetise him due to their vastness and importance.

From peering over his Dad’s shoulder and witnessing the earliest prototypes of the internet in the 1970’s to building Ethereum in dimly lit coworking spaces with Vitalik, Aaron has lived a few lives already at the age of 40. He tells his story in High Definition.

Aaron has certainly spoken to a lot of people throughout his journey.

Those conversations began on the streets of New Jersey during a working-class upbringing. Shovelling snow and delivering pizza gave Aaron the spare change he wanted and the ox-like work ethic he needed to play ball with some of the great minds in the tech space.

After graduating law school and successfully building and selling his first venture, Aaron’s conversations took him deep into the DeFi world. He was at the early Bitcoin meetups, usually hosted in dingy backrooms of New York Chinatown and was instrumental in Ethereum’s early days.

He loves history, economics, law and technology. Topics many find dry, but magnetise him due to their vastness and importance.

From peering over his Dad’s shoulder and witnessing the earliest prototypes of the internet in the 1970’s to building Ethereum in dimly lit coworking spaces with Vitalik, Aaron has lived a few lives already at the age of 40. He tells his story in High Definition.
</h2><p>JACK: Hey, Aaron, thank you so much for coming on High Definition. It&#x27;s a pleasure to have you. Would you be able to just give a quick background on who you are and where you came from? 

AARON: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks so much for having me. I am a professor at Cardozo Law School, a law school in New York, and also the co-founder of a blockchain based project called Open Law, which is building some really interesting blockchain technology related products and services focused on the intersection of the legal industry, smart contracts and digital assets. And we use that technology to pull together recently, a couple new forms of organizations referred to as decentralized autonomous organizations for dApps. So it&#x27;s really great to be here. 

JACK: That&#x27;s a pretty interesting line of work. How do you get started going down that path that sort of entrepreneurial tendencies start from a young age? 

AARON: Yeah, actually, it did. So I don&#x27;t know why. But I&#x27;ve always kind of had the itch to start something on my own. You know, from a young age, I was always looking for different ways to, to make a couple extra bucks or, you know, kind of buy the things that I was hoping to get, I didn&#x27;t really grow up with much real working class background in New Jersey. And, you know, my parents gave me a very meager allowance. So if I wanted anything, I kind of had to earn it myself. So what does that mean? When I was in grade school or grammar school, I was packaging up baseball cards and selling that to my friends at school for $5 a piece so that I could buy things like a remote controlled car. And I started working, when I was legally able to in the US at the age of 15. Working at supermarkets and pharmacies and delivering pizzas and doing a whole bunch there. I rake leaves shoveled snow, really anything I could do to kind of make something happen. I tried to do that. So I always was at school working at least one job sometimes too. And that continued all the way through college, when not only was I going to college, but I was also working one or two jobs. And, and that was right around the time that you know, the first wave the internet was beginning to boom. And one job that actually paid the most on campus was web development. So because of the high hourly rate that was advertised, I was able to convince somebody, and at one of the departments that offered, offered this opportunity to give me a break. And let me learn how to program and do web development on the job. And really, that kind of accelerated my path into technology, I started doing a whole bunch of things in the tech ecosystem. First, I just started building websites for different departments at the university that I was studying at with a good friend of mine that I grew up with. And then I went to law school, because there wasn&#x27;t much work to be had. And that was right around the time, web two was starting and beginning to blossom. And even during law school, I was putting together various different websites and projects and really beginning to tinker around with things like Wikipedia and user generated content. And when I graduated law school, lots of people in the US they congratulate themselves and take a trip to Australia or somewhere far away. That&#x27;s difficult to get to. I decided to build a website in my apartment with a couple other friends and an app but to kind of my first venture as an entrepreneur. That&#x27;s a little bit about my kind of story to entrepreneurship. So I feel like I&#x27;ve always kind of had it in my in my bones in my blood for some reason. 

DAVID: Sure. And maybe go there. So what was your first venture and maybe describe it in in brief? 

AARON: Yeah, so my first venture was a initiative called armchair GM and it was a user generated sports site. So I became enamored after college with Wikipedia, I saw this entire movement of dynamically generated content I just thought was fascinating. So I stumbled upon It while I was studying for classes, I was looking for some more information running a Google search and Wikipedia came up. And I never really had been to the site before. And I thought it was interesting that it had an answer. And I kept on doing that, during the course of my studies, and Wikipedia kept on coming up again and again. And so I began to dig in and really got fascinated with the, with the community and ecosystem. Around the same time I was studying and had studied in college behavioral economics, and, and became kind of fascinated with this notion of groups coming together, kind of neutralizing their biases, and building something that was arguably superior to what an individual could do alone, and just fell down that rabbit hole. And that rabbit hole, I thought, and that technology, I thought would not just apply to encyclopedias, but apply to a whole range of knowledge. And looking around kind of the internet landscape at that, at that point in time, it seemed it seemed like sports was ready to, to kind of undergo a bit of a Renaissance, there was sites in the US like ESPN, which is a popular cable, you know, cable, news entertainment channel, that there wasn&#x27;t really kind of a user generated sports site. So we thought that that would be kind of a good project to begin with. And it turned out that we are right. You know, people love to talk about sports, they know a ton about sports. And we set up and modified the core technology behind Wikipedia, which was open sourced. And people just went nuts. They just started editing and contributing stories, building a whole bunch of different things. And we just kind of raised to keep up with the community. And so grew really quick, we kind of caught lightning in a bottle, which was great. And even though I was working another job, and the folks I dealt with, were also working another job, but just kept on growing and growing and growing and nights, weekends, any free time that we could scrape out, we were dedicating to it, until we got an email from Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, who asked that we meet. And so even though we were pretty happy with how things were going, and we were beginning to contemplate looking for outside capital. And we began to talk with Jimmy wells, the founder of Wikipedia about potentially adopting some of the technology that we had built and modified and extended from Wikipedia, into his new venture, which was called Wikia, which is the for profit version of Wikipedia. And so after a whole bunch of conversations and conversations with other publishing companies in New York, we decided that it would be great to work with Jimmy and help build out the for profit version of Wikipedia called Wikia. And that&#x27;s what we did. So we sold our venture, I&#x27;m sure GM, put a whopping $2,000 into it, and sold it for lack of a lot more. And then, and then that really kind of got me down the path of trying to build, you know, more robust internet technology.

JACK:  That&#x27;s unreal, like the growth from starting with $2,000. And ending up being able to partner up with the founder of Wikipedia is something that&#x27;s kind of, like unbelievable for most people to think that that is a reality that can happen. Did you have that in the back of your mind when you were spending all your waking hours building, armchair GM? Or did it sort of just start coming all into place and falling into line for you? 

AARON: Yeah, you know, we didn&#x27;t even think that that was a possibility. You know, we chose kind of this open source technology powering Wikipedia, because we didn&#x27;t have that much time. So, you know, we just wanted to see this thing come to fruition and thought that this was a good way to do it. And, and thought that Wikipedia and its core engine would be a good place to start. So when we got the email from Jimmy, I remember circulating it to everybody. And we were just kind of blown away. And then, you know, things started pretty mellow. Like we met him in New York. And he was traveling a lot at the time, at a crappy diner down in Chinatown, New York just started talking about what we wanted to do and what we were planning to do. And so our initial vision was to not just have sports, but other kind of verticals related to user generated content. And that is, in many ways what the vision of Wikia was. So I think we&#x27;re really aligned. And at least for me, personally, I also found open source technology, from law school and in other contexts fascinating and really loved that Wikipedia was deciding to open source the content related to it the underlying software, I just felt like that was the Right future and the right way to approach things. So we&#x27;re also pretty philosophically aligned. So it&#x27;s not something that we were aiming to do. But it was definitely a nice opportunity. And you know, and I think to our credit, we beat a lot of these other users generated blogging sites and content sites that that at least popped up in the US things like Bleacher Report. And, you know, a whole bunch of these other services, we always thought they were basically copying the stuff that we had done. So that that was always it&#x27;s nice to be imitated. But it was also great to begin to build out kind of a more broad user generated content platform with Jimmy and a whole bunch of other folks from the Wikipedia and Wikia communities. 

DAVID: Right, and maybe talk more broadly about what that experience was like, what was Jimmy like, as a character?

JACK: Yeah, you know, I, I learned a tremendous amount from Jimmy. And in particular, you know, how to manage and how to think about open source technology. And I also had the pleasure just, you know, being a lawyer, and also going to law school to meet lots of judges, and lots of other people that kind of sat in the middle of a lot of disputes. And I&#x27;d say, outside of some of the judges that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of interacting with, or working for, Jimmy was probably the most judicious human being I&#x27;ve ever met. So if there was ever a dispute, his answer was always a way to find a path forward where both parties were right. And I think that that, that his nature, and his kind of instinct, really bled through and is one of the core reasons why Wikipedia was successful. So if people on Wikipedia were engaged in some sort of edit war, and there was plenty of them, where they couldn&#x27;t come to agreement about something, I do think Jimmy was able to kind of bring them together, so that they could continue to push things forward. And I think managing open source technology is a difficult task, managing a community people is a difficult task. And I think that that that kind of instinct of his was, was really important. The second thing that he kind of drilled, at least into my head, or at least I picked up from him was this notion of not doing too much a priori thinking, they&#x27;re not overthinking a technical problem. So he would always say, if we&#x27;re thinking about new product, or new service, don&#x27;t overthink it, just get it out there, see how people are using it, and then make modifications and changes. And from that, I think, you know, other entrepreneurs, like Mark Zuckerberg of the world, kind of have a more, I guess, aggressive way to phrase that, which is move fast. And, and, and, you know, ship things and and hopefully, they won&#x27;t break right. So move fast and break things. I guess Jamie&#x27;s version of that was don&#x27;t do too much thinking off the bat, just ship, the ship, whatever you want to do. And let&#x27;s see what happens. So that was really important. And then I think the last thing was just kind of the ethos about open source tech and open source technologies is very important. Now it was it was not as important back then. But I do think he was right directionally, just about the way the internet developed. And, and the need to have important pieces of the internet not owned by a company or corporation, but by, you know, different stakeholders from around the globe. So that was critically important. And then the last piece, I would say is the international aspect of Wikia was really interesting. It was fully remote before that was even a thing. So we were on IRC channels, and Skype. And there was no real coordinating office, actually, we, we rented and leased an office in downtown San Francisco, and nobody went to it, which was always kind of a joke internally. So, you know, people were very comfortable. Just talking asynchronously solving issues, you know, remotely hopping on calls, if necessary, without the need for kind of person to person interaction. And I think that that was just ahead of the curve. So yeah, so it was interesting, you know, funny story about onshore GM, we were also remote. So I knew everybody. But everybody on the team didn&#x27;t know one another. And the first time everybody met was actually the day we sold the company. So we met signed all the documents necessary to kind of formalize certain things. And then and then we sold the company right after that, which was kind of bananas. 

JACK: So how about coordinating people in that sort of environment? Like how do you coordinate people that don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re working with each other? Yeah, I mean, it&#x27;s hard. I think, you know,
Wikia, in particular, tried to hire people that were deep in the Wikipedia ecosystem. So in many ways, those people naturally gravitated towards kind of a more asynchronous remote first environment. They were working on articles or dealing with tricky governance issues remotely from months if not years beforehand. And so extending that into Wikia wasn&#x27;t usually a big issue. And there was also, you know, remote development teams, and that&#x27;s where I think things are a little bit harder. You know, if you don&#x27;t have somebody that is accustomed to not working face to face and not working in an office, sometimes there can be an adjustment period. Related to that. I also think you need people that are more expressive in writing. So if you have difficulty, you know, expressing yourself communicating or providing updates. And that&#x27;s just not your natural manner. I think that remote environments tend to tend to be difficult. So, lots of challenges, but I really think it&#x27;s hiring the right people that are kind of are self selecting into this, making sure that they&#x27;re expressive, particularly in writing, and making sure that they, you know, they really care and are aligned when it comes to the vision, mission and passion in what you&#x27;re trying to do. And I think if you can kind of find those folks, and sometimes they&#x27;re rare, sometimes they may be a little bit odd in person, you can build something pretty magical. 

DAVID: Right and earlier, you said that you would kept your day job during this period, what was your day job during that period. 

AARON: So it was a lawyer. So I was working at a major, US based international law firm, and pounding away on various different legal matters during the day, and those were long days. And then it would be up till 234 am putting out fires, trying to scale things, trying to update the design or, or fixings doing a whole bunch of different tasks, and everybody was pretty much doing the same thing. We were all kind of doing it as a side hustle. 

DAVID: So you were doing 17 hour days for a few years

AARON:  I pretty much been doing, you know, 12 to 17 hour days, for my entire life. So I&#x27;m just kind of accustomed to it at this point.

JACK: Where do you get that motivation? That is, like, there&#x27;s not many people that do that. 

AARON: I don&#x27;t know, you know, I just I&#x27;ve always, always since I was young, like I noted before, I&#x27;ve always had to do my schoolwork, I always had a job on the side. So my days were always filled, did sports, they were pretty packed. So I really don&#x27;t know anything different. And I think once you start, it&#x27;s easy to keep on going. And, you know, I never really stopped. So maybe if I stopped and reflected on some of my internal madness, and then maybe that would cause an issue, but not yet.

JACK:  Do you feel like you missed out on some important aspects of life...

AARON: no, no, I think, you know, I think I&#x27;m fortunate in what I&#x27;ve been able to do that I&#x27;ve been able to work on great projects, great people with inspiring people. And, and I really, you know, in a certain way been able to, to help build this future. And when it&#x27;s more equitable, one that&#x27;s more participatory one that&#x27;s more global in nature, and, and one that hopefully, is fair and kind of root out fraud and some of the other corruption and some of the other issues that we see across the globe, that hurts people. So being able to do that, as a law professor and thinking about important policy decisions. We&#x27;re building technology that may be able to provide competitive pressure on legacy businesses that have maybe grown too fat, to fat profit margins, I think that&#x27;s a really healthy thing to be a part of helping to build knowledge bases, Wikipedia, and Wikia is critically important. You know, I do really believe that information is kind of the key to, you know, to progress and also to the future of humanity, of humanity. So I&#x27;ve been fortunate to work with great folks and, and work on really interesting things. And I do have a fair amount of flexibility in what I can do and the latitude of what I do on a day to day basis.

DAVID: Absolutely. And I guess maybe take us to the next period. So you sold the company. What happens next for you, and how does that lead to where you are today? 

AARON: Yeah, so once I sold the company, I spent a lot of time helping to scale Wikia. So when we joined Wikia, it was actually called the WIKIS that was animated by, you know, web one company called geo cities. And it was a whole constellation of Wikis. So the elevator pitch was if Wikipedia was the encyclopedia, Wikia was hoping to be the rest of library. And we went through, you know, startups journeys, so I was, I think, the third employee after the acquisition of Wikia. And it was super small, really small team that didn&#x27;t have that much traffic. And we went through the process of scaling that too, according to Quantcast, and some other sites that keep track of metrics, the 17th largest site in the planet. And we did that in lots of different ways. We ran a whole bunch of experiments to see different verticals, that would work, we acquired a whole bunch of different smaller wiki base projects. So we rolled up entire industries, we worked on scaling solutions that ultimately led to the spin out of technology that&#x27;s at the core of a company called fastly, which just went public a couple years ago, we cut partnerships with a whole bunch of different folks so that you know, more and more people could begin to think about how to, you know, use and enjoy user generated content. So that was a complete wild ride. And the company grew from a handful of people to over 40 people and, and I helped do that. And we also because Jimmy was talking to a reporter And decided that it would be a good idea to talk about search and how search should be open sourced and the algorithm should be open source, he was ahead of the curve there. This is before DuckDuckGo, or other kind of more open source search engines hit the market. We spent some time also building something called Wikia search, which was one of the first open source search engines and began to try to compete against Google to try to take a little bit of the wind out of their sails. Because I do think as a, my personal perspective, , yes, search should be open source. And it was a big task, I could tell you that I have a tremendous amount of respect for all the engineers at Google, we would come up with a new innovative way to do something, and a couple of days or weeks later, it would be incorporated into Google. So we definitely hit their radar. And they definitely were saying, if you want to come at us, we are ready to play. So that was a that was pretty fun, too. You know, and watching a young company grow is has its challenges, personnel challenges, you know, time challenges, but it was also really exciting. And a really great experience. And I learned a lot about, you know, how Silicon Valley worked. Because we went through a couple rounds of financing. I learned a lot of doubt, scaling teams, and I learned a lot about, you know, how to manage technologists and also learned a lot about, you know, building a company at scale, which is difficult. So that&#x27;s a really wonderful lessons there. And that kind of led me into other open source tech and most notably blockchain technology.

DAVID: Right And maybe, what are the key lessons maybe that you did learn from Silicon Valley and did learn from maybe during the Sandhill road, you know, trip?

AARON: Yeah. So, you know, I learned that it&#x27;s hard to raise venture capital. So you know, this was around 2000. And, you know, 2008, to 2009. So that the venture capital industry in the US has grown dramatically over the past, you know, 10 plus years, both in terms of the capital that&#x27;s there, the types of investors, the structuring of the deals that become much more standardized at that point in time, a lot of the information that you can find today about raising capital, building a company, it just wasn&#x27;t, it wasn&#x27;t out there. It wasn&#x27;t in the ether of the internet. So kind of learning the playbook from  the CEO of Wikia, a man by the name of Gilpin Gina, who happens to also be a phenomenal angel investor, and is back some of the best companies on the planet was great, you know, it really got me to think about technology and its potential in a whole new way. And there was a lot to learn about that. I also learned a lot about scaling. I do think one of the advantages that us tech companies still have is that they know the playbook on how to scale a company from, you know, a fairly large business to no global, international, massive, you know, quasi monopoly. And just seeing the difficulty and building a company at scale and deploying that out to millions of users. There&#x27;s just a lot of lessons there. Both in terms of technical lessons, and the difficulty managing data and keeping sites up and, and also lessons about user feedback and making sure that users are happy and making sure that you kind of manage some changes to the site, to all the complexity, just dealing with the press and other folks related to that as well. So it was a really informative time. 

JACK: And are you still in contact with Jimmy? It seems like he was definitely a large figure in, in God in your sort of vision as well. Do you still have regular chats with him? 

AARON: Yeah, I mean, you know, we, yeah, you know, periodically, he&#x27;s, he&#x27;s kind of stepped away a bit from Wikipedia. He&#x27;s really candidate over to the community. And it&#x27;s focused on some other things. But yeah, we catch up periodically. He&#x27;s a really nice guy. I mean, it was nice. We got to work in the same office with them for six months, we kind of were holed up building and building this open source search engine. And that was a really exciting time. 

DAVID: Right. And I guess, an important question would be how you applied some of the legal thinking to that the context that you found yourself in? And I guess an important question is how that led to where you are now and what your involvement was with ethereum project.

AARON: Yeah, so in part, I stumbled upon Bitcoin because I&#x27;m super fascinated with open source technology, just like I was describing, from my time at Wikipedia, and even before or around Wikipedia, and an application. And, you know, if there was any, any new, interesting open source tech, I&#x27;d always you know, kick the tires on it, check it out, see what was going on there. And was, you know, an avid reader of various different tech sites and I just fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole pretty early.
2011 I just started digging in and really thinking about it. And it kind of hit me in not just the, from the perspective of being really cool open source technology. But it also had other aspects that I was interested in most notably, economics, which is what I majored in one of my majors in college. So I kind of liked that this was an open source system that also had an economic component to it. And I just found it fascinating. And so after I left Wikia, and after the CEO of Wikia who I worked under left Wikia, he was thinking about a new payment system, a new kind of payment startup. This was before a lot of FinTech payments, startups emerged. And I was super into bitcoin. And I remember sending him an email saying, why don&#x27;t we build something on Bitcoin? And he wrote back, I don&#x27;t believe in tulips, which I periodically will send back to them just to make them make them laugh. So you know, I think I kind of saw, I think earlier than some other folks did, what was the aspirational goals of Bitcoin, which was to really build a global payments or a financial system that didn&#x27;t have some sort of Central controller, or central operator. And I just thought that was fascinating. And because I was fascinated by it, I started going to Bitcoin meetups in, in New York, you know, starting in 2012, and 2013, and 2014. And they were really interesting places. So they&#x27;d be like, held in Chinatown in some random shop, like in the back, and, you know, and random offices. But it was a really fascinating community. And really, for the first time, since I saw the birth of the internet, that I feel that energy again, like people were into it, because of the technology, they kind of had that glassy eyed idealism that pervaded around the internet. And I just thought it was great. And I met some really interesting people, really smart people, and just kept on spending more and more time immersing myself in that ecosystem. And around that time, I began also thinking about protocols not just for money, but also for law and thinking about how Bitcoin could be more generalized. And viewing it not just as a payment system, but really as a protocol as an entire system. And because of that thought process, I remember messaging, when my friends from my Wikia days saying, I really think that there should be a protocol for law, there should be like a legal protocol, something like Bitcoin for law. And he wrote back to me, that sounds really hard. And I said, it does sound hard, but I feel like that&#x27;s what should be built. And about a month later. And, and this was about a month later, metallic announced Ethereum. And so I was thinking a lot about, you know, protocols for law. And metallic was announcing projects that were talking about smart contracts, right. And generalizing that, and it was pretty darn close to some of the thoughts that I that I was thinking about at that point in time. So I think there was something in the ether, pun completely intended. And I just thought it was really, really interesting project and began to dig in deeper and deeper. You know, at that point in time, you know, Bitcoin was the kind of the, the big kid in the schoolyard. And everybody thought that it was only going to be Bitcoin there was only going to be kind of one blockchain. And it was hard to know whether or not a theorem was going to be a legitimate project. There was a lot of kind of projects that were interesting, but you didn&#x27;t know if they could be done technically. There was a lot of projects that you weren&#x27;t sure if they were legitimate, or they were just trying to make a quick buck. So I had questions about it there and off the bat. And I, you know, went to the website, the team behind it, and noticed that Joe Lubin was helping it out. And I saw that Joe Lubin was speaking at a tech event in New York, and I never paid for any tickets to go to any events, but I paid for ticket to go to event he was speaking at. And this whole purpose was just to say hi to Joe, and see if I could help out. At that point, I was just about to start as a professor at Cardozo law school. So I went to this event, Joe gave his talk with somebody from you know, Dogecoin, it was somebody from digital currency group that was speaking, and a handful of other folks. And after the talk, I went up to Joe and said, I think the room is amazing. Let me know how I can help out in any way. We exchange information and, and then we just started talking and so he invited me to the office where kind of the New York part of the ethereum ecosystem was working out of and started meeting, you know, folks that were helping to build it and just continuing to fall down ethereum rabbit hole

DAVID: Right, and what is continuing to fall down the rabbit hole look like for you what happened next?

AARON: Yeah, so you know that where ethereum was being built in part in New York was not glamorous, it was in Times Square. And New York, it was in a co working space, and not something that looked like a we work, it was a dimly lit, orange, yellow hued co working space that looks like it was built before people even knew the term co working space. And Joe had a little office in there, and, you know, folks would float in, and I just started working at it there. And, and, you know, Metallica would come into town and Charles Hopkins, who&#x27;s done a lot with cardano, sometimes would be there, keep them on would float by, and there&#x27;s a lot in our own right. And, you know, various different people that were part of the ethereum ecosystem would just be there either building, talking, discussing, and it was super interesting. And, you know, from that, I offered to help out with some of the legal structuring, just thinking through, you know, how to do it there in in a in a responsible way, and in a way that, you know, hopefully would give it a shot, and to grow and succeed without running into regulatory challenges. So I put a lot of time and effort into that. And I also had the pleasure of thinking through how to support a ethereum with in not just legal ways, but also supporting it by helping to build out some research components of it. So me, vitalik and Kieran Lubin, Jonathan sun put together an organization called the cryptocurrency research group. And we began to think about and plan different events related to solving some of the vexing technical, economic and legal issues related to blockchain technology, things that I think folks that have looked at blockchain technology have thought about quite a bit in some capacity. So we put together and Kieran really took the lead here the first major conference on crypto economics called crypto economic con, which was held in Silicon Valley. You know, folks from ethereum ripple, what&#x27;s now definitely, and lots of different projects, lots of different people that have built really nice careers in the blockchain ecosystem. Were all there and began writing a bit, started writing a paper with a co author who was a fellow at the Berkman Center at Harvard University on hard problems and crypto law. And started thinking about lots of the tricky issues that the technology would develop, and really started thinking deeply about smart contracts and, and how they can, how can how they can apply and impact the world. And so this paper, hard problems and crypto law, turned into a book. So we intended it to be a paper. Some editors at Harvard thought it was really interesting. So that turned into a book that Harvard University Press published. So that took quite a bit of time. And then from that research, I started doing a lot more when it comes to when it came to smart contracts as legal contracts. So that&#x27;s, in part what I&#x27;ve been trying to, to work through with a project called Obamacare. And, and lots of other events happened along the way, you know, we hosted and you know, at Cardozo law school, the first security meetup and from that first ethereum meetup, the Genesis insurance of a company called consensus was born. A lot of the people that joined consensus and helped build consensus, we&#x27;re at that meetup. And I got to work with a number of great teams, from my time around the current ecosystem. So that&#x27;s when I met Sergei and Steve from chainlink, and began to help them out of it and help them think through, you know, the types of products and services that they may offer, which and channeling for folks that may not know it is a, you know, significant and major blockchain based project. I think it&#x27;s one of the top 10 at least measured by market cap, and began to help Joe and think about what consensus should look like and, and how it should be structured and what types of things that you focus on. So lots of really interesting conversations around that time. 

DAVID: Right. And it must be wild to see to have seen consensus grow from the start, but I do want to take a step back and sort of frame the problem that you were initially trying to solve around, you know, structuring, do you put it in a responsible way of the ethereum project? How would you characterize the problem that you face and what were you solving for? 

AARON: Yeah, so the problem was, you know, the folks that wanted to build the theorem didn&#x27;t really have the capital to do so. Now, you know, as any entrepreneur knows, it&#x27;s hard to build technology. You need people to be focused on it at the time and space to build something new. And one thing that Metallica was hoping to do was to exchange Bitcoin for a future promise of ether if ethereum network launched. And that&#x27;s just a tricky issue, because you&#x27;re exchanging one digital asset for another. So there&#x27;s tricky issues when it came to simple questions today seemed almost commonplace. But can you exchange Bitcoin for another asset, people didn&#x27;t have answers at that point in time to whether or not you could do that? Are you able to have people donate to Bitcoin so that you can begin to build a project? Right? If you&#x27;re going to do that, and you want to build an open source platform, where should it be located? Should it be located in the US should be located in Europe should be located in Asia? questions related to that?
And it has questions about how the network should be rolled out. You know, should that be sorted by one party by multiple parties? What&#x27;s the right way to do it? Not just from a legal regulatory perspective, but also from the success of the project perspective, if you truly believe that you&#x27;re trying to build a global permission list, and generalized blockchain that can support lots of different assets, what does that look like? Right, should be owned by one person should be owned by foundation? So lots of challenging questions are, are kind of embedded in, in, in very broad platform like technologies, like, you know, like, Eethereum. And so we began to sort those out. And there was lots of people who, who felt that what ethereum did may run into securities laws issues. And I, I personally think that it didn&#x27;t, you know, it was really a saleable product. That product was ether, and gas for, for network. And, and it was a little bit different than a lot of the token sales that we saw, subsequently, after the launch of ethereum. 

JACK: And when you were solving these sort of problems, was it you and vitalik, in a room with a whiteboard? What did it look like? Was it in these underground basements behind closed doors?

AARON: Yeah, it wasn&#x27;t really underground base. And so just a series of conversations and talking to different folks and getting input. It was very open source, right. And, you know, doing things kind of in a cloaked way doesn&#x27;t really work, usually get the best answer when you talk to a lot of people get feedback, and people push back on it, and then you just make your best decisions that could be made. So you know, that that&#x27;s what it was like, it was in a very unglamorous place, right, this kind of dingy, co working space. And in midtown Manhattan. It&#x27;s a glamorous location near Atlanta space. 

DAVID: Right. And did you get the sense that what you were building had extremely sort of broad implications for the way that society, I guess, could work?

AARON: Yeah, I mean, I had the inkling. And in part, I decided to allocate too much time to it, because I thought the folks that were building it, not everyone, but a number of the folks that were building it were really special. And that, that I think I learned from my Wikipedia days, you know, there&#x27;s certain people that I thought had a knack for building an open source project. And a lot of the folks that were at Wikia didn&#x27;t just work there, but had previously either led or built some pretty significant open source technology. And I just saw in vitalik, and the way Joe was, was helping and participating. And with Gavin wood, who&#x27;s obviously gone to, to build a couple significant open source projects. They just had that right next, and they had kind of the right approach to things. And I thought vitalik was a bonafide genius. And he would, he was young. At that point, I think he was 19. But he had, he was incredibly smart. He was incredibly hardworking. And, you know, he would write incredibly lucid things just by sitting down and, and pounding it out, actually never saw somebody like that. So I really thought he had a really special mind. And, you know, Joe, is, you know, equally brilliant, you know, Princeton educated, long history of building successful projects before he got to Ethereum. And I just thought he really had a knack for kind of stirring things. I thought, Gavin wood was a genius, as well, and really had the feeling that he had the technical chops to do it. But there was lots of questions as to whether or Ethereum could be built. A lot of the naysayers in the Bitcoin ecosystem didn&#x27;t think it was technically feasible for it to happen. So people were holding their breath at it, but once you started to see it, operating, once you&#x27;re able to play around with it on test net, you know, you could tell that something special was kind of happening there. But I think, you know, from my vantage point, even though you could tell something  special is happening, I think a ethereum is always kind of outpaced the really ambitious goals, etc. Both in terms of adoption and use cases and applications. And you can kind of always, you can kind of always think about how technology is going to develop, but when you&#x27;re kind of in the middle of it, it sometimes can be a bit surprising. And I think Ethereum is always surprised me just in terms of its resiliency, and, and really its ability to kind of fulfill its vision. 

JACK: And I guess, given where we are today, are you surprised?

AARON: At this point? I&#x27;m not right. I feel like the you know, division was clear. The technical implementation, I think was done. Well, right. And, you know, there&#x27;s always questions about open source technology and its quality, and people can always snipe around the edges. But at this point, you&#x27;d have a system that&#x27;s been in operation for over six years. And it&#x27;s moving a tremendous amount of value securely. And a lot of the use cases that people were talking about in, you know, 20, late 2014 and 2015. And, you know, frankly, even earlier than that, and the Bitcoin ecosystem, they&#x27;re coming into existence, right. So back then everybody was talking about DFI, they just were calling it smart derivatives, smart options. You know, people were thinking about stable coin implementations back then. And that&#x27;s been implemented. They were talking about on block chains and block chains being used for provenance and kind of the whole NFT or non fungible token boom that we&#x27;re seeing right now was talked about the first demos that I that I saw, and this was at an event at Harvard, when Cavalia was showing kind of an early prototype for Ethereum was gaff coin, right? So people are been toying around with personal tokens right now. But really, that was the first use case that I that I remember seeing on ethereum off the bat. So a lot of the pieces that people were talking about, the tech is finally caught up to that vision. And at least when it comes to the pure crypto side, so at this point, it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not surprising. And but I would say it was surprising, as was, as it was growing because it grew really fast, right? When you see hyperbolic growth, it&#x27;s still hard for your mind to kind of wrap around it. I&#x27;ll give you one little story here, grab a drink with Joe, just to catch up, went to soccer bar in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Nice place, meeting up with another academic just to kind of talk about auction policy stuff. And it was like a Tuesday night, Monday night, you know, working nights, so wasn&#x27;t that crowded couple people on the soccer bar. And having a nice time, waitress was really friendly, asked, you know, Joe, what he did mention it, that he&#x27;s done a lot with ethereum mentioned that, you know, that it&#x27;s been really fun. And the table next to us, to two women. They were just having a nice time, they overheard the conversation and turned, opened up their wallets, which had Coinbase apps on them and showed you how they both own ether. And I remember turning to Joe at that point in time and being like, what is happening? What is going on? So that was kind of one of those moments when, you know, because we were deep in it, but we were in the weeds. I think for me at least I was missing kind of the forest for the trees. And but but then at that point, I think we recognized that it was becoming a bit of a phenomenon

DAVID: Right. And I guess, an initial problem that you, you mentioned that you were solving for was around this idea of there being a legal protocol that is sort of instantiated within the wider Western world, if you will. Where have you gotten to with that project? And maybe frame where you are now?

AARON: Yeah, I mean, so, you know, Bitcoin didn&#x27;t come out of thin air, there was a long conversation, in particular from a group of folks that call themselves cypherpunks, that have been thinking about the use of strong cryptography, and how it can be used to transform the world. And, and, you know, these were the folks that were experimenting with different digital cash systems, or E cash systems for years before Bitcoin was launched. And a lot of those folks were not just talking about digital cash, they were also talking quite a bit about digital contracts. And, and, you know, it&#x27;s always hard to have a consensus in a morphus group. But there seem to be a number of folks that recognize that, to really rebuild the commercial system, you&#x27;re gonna need three core pieces. One piece is digital cash system, something like Bitcoin, or some digital asset that kind of serves as a base currency. The second one would be an E write system, where smart contracts in a system where you can define rights and obligations around those assets. And the third one was a notion called a recording contract, or a contract in the traditional sense that we&#x27;ll be able to manage risk, and not only manage risk, but be digestible, understandable, and interpretable by machines. And thus far, we&#x27;ve seen digital payment systems like Bitcoin, and stable coin systems that are on top of ethereum. To have a stable value. We&#x27;ve seen ethereum itself effectively be a smart contracting system, where you can structure the transfer of assets, you can structure rights and obligations related to assets. But there wasn&#x27;t anybody that was making a substantive effort at building this last leg, which is a recording contracting system. So I became fascinated with it and just wanted to figure out what that could look like, you know, how could we turn these dusty, very boring things called contracts into digital systems, digital artifacts, that are able to read information, right information, and an end are interpretable by humans and machines. That&#x27;s a pretty vexing problem. And so we began to think about what that could look like. And that manifested into open law. And open law, what it enables folks to do is to take any agreement and structure it so that underneath the hood, it&#x27;s a data object, it&#x27;s something a computer to understand. But when you look at it, it looks like a normal, everyday boring contract. And it also can interact closely with smart contracts. So the moment somebody signs the agreement, just like you would on DocuSign, or hellosign, e signature solution system, it has the whole power of a blockchain sitting behind it. So if you wanted to move an asset, if you wanted to transfer an asset, if you wanted to create a new organization, you can do that. Right, from a signature, or right when all the parties that were necessary to sign something had signed it. And, you know, we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve come really close, and I think it&#x27;s a great attempt at an If not, hopefully, a solution to a recording and contracting system. You know, contracts are important. contracts that have existed since Mesopotamia.
That&#x27;s where archaeologists have found the first contracts. And think about that for a second. Humans got together to build societies. Some people credit that so that they could brew beer, right and, and do that and get drunk and like, and manage grain in a more efficient way. And the next thing that they spent time doing was drafting contracts. So as long as we&#x27;ve gotten together as societies, we&#x27;ve had these artifacts called contracts that have existed. And yet, they&#x27;re not that dissimilar from what we had in Mesopotamia, right, they&#x27;re still written down for the most part, they&#x27;re still hard to parse hard to understand. And, and I think we can do better. And that in many ways, I think, is one of the sub stories of this commercial revolution that&#x27;s happening around blockchains. Like how can we actually have better commercial relationships so that the world can be knitted together a little bit more closely? A little bit more securely? And hopefully, make sure that people can do things that they&#x27;re hoping to do in a more efficient way. 

DAVID: Right, and I guess, how does that sort of frame your vision for how companies will form in future and what I guess the corporate world could look like?

AARON: Yeah, I think it&#x27;s, I think what we&#x27;re, we haven&#x27;t yet seen in widespread adoption is a new digital form. With an organization, so historically, with each tech revolution that we&#x27;ve had, there&#x27;s also been innovations when it comes to legal structuring. So if you go back to, as an example, the birth of industrialization in the US, at least, that led to the creation of the modern Corporation. So a corporation that wasn&#x27;t chartered by a state, like what we saw in Europe, but a corporation that can be chartered by any citizen. So that started here in the US, after the Revolutionary War, in 1811, in New York, so folks decided, hey, if you want to start a business, that&#x27;s great, you can ask the state for permission, it&#x27;s going to be freely granted. And that means you&#x27;re not going to put your assets at stake. And so that that was one of the major reasons, this joint stock company, one of the major reasons that people were able to engage in industry, right, they could start a whole bunch of different companies, whether that was, you know, a company to know wheat, or to weave clothing, where it makes shoes, right, they could begin to the process of industrialization in the mid 1800s. With the birth of the railroads, people had to figure out a way to assemble capital, right. So you could build something really expensive, like a railroad system, those were not cheap things to build, you know, they&#x27;re not cheap today, they weren&#x27;t cheap back then. And that led to the birth of preferred stock. So different innovations when it came to, you know, how stock should be structured inside of a company. And that fueled a whole bunch of innovation, both by roads, and also what you&#x27;re seeing today in Silicon Valley, the structuring underneath most venture capital investments, pretty much older there, you pay an homage to, to how Barrow deals were done in the 1880s, as globalization took root, in the late 1970s, and into the 80s, and 90s. And today, there was another innovation, the limited liability company, where, again, happened to happen in the US. But a state Wyoming said, Hey, if you want to structure, an organization, you can do it. And you can do it any way that you want. As long as you&#x27;ve got a contract in place that clearly defines what everybody&#x27;s going to be doing. And that flexibility, enabled a whole host of different enterprises, from mining operations, which was the first use case for an LLC, to hedge funds and private equity funds and all these pools of capital that we see around the globe. But we&#x27;re no longer in an industrial era.
We&#x27;re in the internet era. And we haven&#x27;t yet seen the widespread adoption of a digitally native organization, one that kind of reflects this substrate of the internet. And that is, in my mind, a decentralized autonomous organization, or an entirely digital organization, those organizations I think, are going to be a little bit different than corporations, they&#x27;re going to rely on software, smart contracts, to kind of manage capital, and knit people together, why it&#x27;s really efficient and easy to use this technology to collect capital and manage it. Secondly, they&#x27;re probably not going to have formal boards or managers. It&#x27;s actually better, I think we&#x27;re increasingly seeing this quitting on things like with GameStop, to have a whole broad group of people that are supporting or backing a project, actually getting more stakeholders involved, creates a more stable environment. And guys, I think have that capability to enable folks that are really interested in a particular company or project or enterprise to be involved in its future growth. And last, it can scale globally, right. So when we think of organizations today, we think about them in terms of our country, so it&#x27;s a US company, or Australian company, right, or Canadian company, or, you know, a company based in Singapore, or some other some other jurisdiction, I think increasingly, those differences, when it comes to national borders are just gonna matter, a heck of a lot less. And organizations that are relying on a ethereum relying on smart contracts, and have these characteristics I think just grabbed nicely onto this world that I think has been built.
And so I find that that&#x27;s going to be really fascinating part of the future of the next, you know, 510 15 years, these organizations will continue to grow, they&#x27;ll continue to manage more capital. And I might, my gut tells me that they&#x27;re going to be more efficient than existing enterprises. So like we saw, and are seeing with Bitcoin and ethereum and digital assets, it just kind of suck in value. My sense is Dallas will continue to suck in every form of organization. Until it it&#x27;s one of the dominant if not the dominant form of organization around the book.  

DAVID: Right and maybe speak to the relationship between your involvement, I guess, or interest with open source communities, and user driven development of platforms and how that&#x27;s relevant to what you&#x27;re currently doing.

AARON: Yeah, that&#x27;s a really great point, you know many ways. And the activity that&#x27;s going on in the blockchain ecosystems is, is just the tip of, of activity that has gone on in open source communities for a while. Now, open source communities are very flat. Oftentimes,
no leader, there&#x27;s a group of leaders, people come in and out, people spend a couple months on a project, and then we&#x27;ll fade away, new folks will emerge, and there&#x27;s no structure or formal structure around them. And there&#x27;s a, there&#x27;s a really open borders to how people can participate in it. So if you wanted to contribute to an open source project, you can, you just have to download the code, find where people are talking about it and jump in. And I think that that&#x27;s, in a sense, the way organizations will look in the future, there&#x27;ll be less formal, less hierarchical, and a little bit more open and permission less. And I think what we&#x27;re seeing in the blockchain ecosystem will eventually bleed back into open source technology. And since open source technology has such a huge footprint and an increasingly important footprint around the globe, it will become the standard. And as it becomes a standard, and as you&#x27;re increasingly able to monetize open source, it, I think, will become the structure of choice for more and more technology projects. And if you believe this hypothesis, that software will eventually eat the world. And a software developers prefer open source technology, well, then, you can imagine how these types of organizations may be the primary vehicle. So if the software developers, likes open source technology, and if this is a great way to organize something that looks like an open source project, well, then decentralized organizations or these digital organizations may be the pathway to the future.

DAVID: Right? And what else have you been involved with? 

AARON: Quite a bit, Quite a number. So you know, one, one data that I or something that you can consider a Dao is possibly Bitcoin, right? So Bitcoin is open permissionless, that it relies on software to coordinate activity, there&#x27;s no person or single person that&#x27;s in charge of it, people float in and out of it in different ways. You know, so, you know, I definitely participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem, I think you could say the same thing about ethereum. Nobody really runs ethereum retallack and some other folks may have created it, but you can&#x27;t do that much. Now to change it, you can express his opinion, but if people disagree, it&#x27;s not gonna really matter much. And I&#x27;ve also more recently spent some time sorting through, you know, what guys can look like the US given the current regulatory environment through a couple projects. One project is called LAO, and the second one is called slimming down. And LAO is really focused on how to support blockchain based projects, and ventures starway. So providing capital that young technologists or technology teams need in order to, to grow project, and Flamengo Dao is focused in on acquiring digital art, and other digital collectibles and other things that are scarce and natively recorded onto a blockchain. And both are really interesting projects. There&#x27;s about $25 million in ether that have been contributed to both of these DAOs, and 30 plus projects and hundreds of pieces of digital art and other collectibles that have been acquired. So they&#x27;ve been super interesting, and really, really fulfilling to be able to help hold together and, and hopefully help grow.

JACK: Just to just to bring it back on you for a second. How would you characterize the subjects that fascinate you? How would you box those into a single category?

AARON: I mean, I think that the things I&#x27;ve always been interested in are technology. And maybe I&#x27;ll take a step back. My dad was a scientific researcher in the United States. He was on the internet since the 1970s. So when before the there was the Internet, and early prototypes, the internet, my dad was on it. So he was one of the scientific researchers that had access to it for sharing information. He worked for the government. So my life has been dominated by computers. So even though I&#x27;m 40 Now, the first time I was on the internet was when I was five. So I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people that was natively digital. And so technology has always played an important role in my life. You know, I remember First Family Computer when I was five and playing video games. I vividly remember the first time I downloaded a JPEG over the internet, with my friend in his basement and cheering when we this image progressively load on the screen. I remember being in that same business and learning about amazing technology projects, like Google for the first time. And technology&#x27;s always played really an outsized role in my life. And I&#x27;ve always been fascinated with making things better, you know, building a better world. And to me, technology&#x27;s always the best pathway to that, you know, you can make the world better by coming up with more sensible rules, but you can oftentimes just make things better by making better things, and better systems. And so technology&#x27;s always been important. I majored in college and history and economics. So I think there&#x27;s a lot of lessons to learn from the past. I think, you know, while history doesn&#x27;t repeat itself, certain patterns do. And I think that&#x27;s always been important. So I&#x27;ve always looked for kind of broad patterns and thinking. And then economics is important, right, economics is fundamentally about aligning incentives. And I do think that outside of technology, economics is a really important thing to know. And then the last is law. I just think law is really interesting. You know, it&#x27;s kind of the architecture for the world and thinking about how to structure society and make sure that people are nice and kind and fair to one another is really important. And so, I find that endlessly fascinating. So, you know, my interests are, are dry, right there, history, economics, technology. And last, but I&#x27;m definitely a nonfiction type person. And it&#x27;s been a heck of a lot of time reading.

Jack: I guess I&#x27;m interested to know why. subjects that are apparently so dry, like they are quite dry, I&#x27;m not gonna lie. But how are they so rich for you? I still can&#x27;t really understand that. Why do you seek so much interest or find so much value in learning these things, other than trying to push yourself to learn them? Because you know, that they&#x27;re important to know.

AARON: Yeah, it&#x27;s never really been an important. You know, I just, I think for maybe it&#x27;s the challenge, you know, I do think that there&#x27;s something about trying to tackle a really, really large, difficult body of knowledge that I find interesting. So, you know, law is vast, you could spend your whole life reading legal texts and books and, you know, barely scratching the surface. And there&#x27;s something very humbling about that. And I&#x27;ve always found that fascinating. History is the same way, right history can be told from so many different voices, and so many different perspectives. And people have different narratives of certain accounts. So pulling together a picture of what the past looks like, is difficult. And economics, I think, is the same way. Yeah, I think there&#x27;s a lot a lot we still need to learn about, about how to structure incentives and do it the right way. And, you know, many ways, I feel like, in hindsight, we&#x27;ll probably look at some of the leading economic thinkers today know that they were boneheaded, or, or misguided or didn&#x27;t know enough about how things work. So I think there&#x27;s a bunch of that. And then technology, technology is really the synthesis of selling different things. And you know, even looking at blockchains, the technology was old. Well, that tech existed since the 1970s, peer to peer networks, that&#x27;s the internet, after all those early peer to peer file sharing systems.
You know, hashing has been around for a while, public, private key cryptography was around for a while, even the consensus algorithms that help people record information to a blockchain were around for a while. But it&#x27;s kind of that process of assembling that all together. That&#x27;s pretty, pretty fascinating. So, you know, it&#x27;s not always being the most clever or coming up with the most bleeding edge thing. Sometimes it&#x27;s just looking at a problem in a different way. And assembling it and applying technology that exists in one sector into another sector. So I always find that kind of fascinating. And I think that&#x27;s the core of the human imagination. So I can endlessly read about it, you know, summit project, and really try to understand what people are trying to build and how they, how they envision a future that&#x27;s hopefully better than what it is today. So I would say, you know, it&#x27;s not really the target your question. It&#x27;s probably the vastness of it. And then and the challenge that makes it interesting. 

JACK: And is it on a need to know basis when you do this research? Or is it more so?
Just your research is guided by pure fascination? 

AARON: Yeah, it&#x27;s usually like that. I tend to focus on just things that I find interesting. And then I just keep on scratching that itch until I feel satisfied. So it&#x27;s just more curiosity. 

JACK: Yeah. And you&#x27;ve got the big itches. 

AARON: Yeah, I mean, I just, you know, I guess my issues last longer than others. So if if I find a topic interesting, I really want to dig in and understand it and make sure I have at least enough knowledge in it to be dangerous. So you know, necessarily need to be the expert, but sometimes that happens. But usually that&#x27;s the case. 

JACK: You definitely seem dangerous.

AARON: Yeah. In a good way. Yeah. pleasantly dangerous.

JACK: Pleasantly Dangerous Exactly.

DAVID: Where can people go and find you?

AARON: Where can they find me I&#x27;m on Twitter, my handle is @awrigh01. And if they are interested in learning more about blockchains and their legal implications. They can check out the book that I co-authored. It&#x27;s called blockchain and the law, the rule of code, which I think is a nice real for folks that want to think about some of the legal and policy challenges. If you&#x27;re interested in tech, you can check out openlaw.io, which is the tech platform and all the documentation related to it. If you&#x27;re interested in DAOs, you can check outLAO.io or Flamingo Dao, FlamingoDao.XYZ, and, and those are all on Twitter. So you can follow that as well.

JACK: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for coming on. Aaron, it was great talking with you. 

AARON: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.

JACK: Cheers.

AARON: Cheers.
