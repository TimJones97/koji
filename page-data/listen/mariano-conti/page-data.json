Would we be able to start off with just a little bit about yourself and your background?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So myself, I'm the co-founder of CoinGecko. So basically, this goes back way back in the past, where I discovered Bitcoin back in 2013. So the thing is that I wasn't really into finance, like growing up, I never knew how money came to be, and what it is all about, like, no one actually teach me that sort of thing. Like, even for my family, my background, and family are mainly a middle class. And starting a business wasn't what I was supposed to do, like generally, the advice is, get a good grade in school, and then get a good job. But then, somehow, I think when I was 14 to 15 years old, I sort of got interested in computers. And I started off by doing some flash animation. I’m not an artist, I’m not an animator, but it got me to realize that I could use computers to program anything. And then at about 17, my brother mentioned to me that, you know, whether you check out Ruby-on-Rails framework for web development. So that's when I started jumping into the rabbit hole for  web development, and then eventually had the chance to go to the US to study computer science and ended up in the Midwest, where it's not really a startup hub like Silicon Valley. But I just focused on learning about writing programs, writing about development, contributing to open source programs. Then when I hit back to Malaysia, and then started getting a job in a company in Singapore to work for an Airbnb competitor at a time in 2013, there were many players going after the short term rental market. And on the side, when I was earning a salary, I was thinking of ways to invest my money, right. And I stumbled upon precious metals like gold and silver. And it got me to research more about the history of money, which I know nothing about in my entire life. So I spent some time in internet forums, and then something caught my attention where people are talking about Bitcoin being a better version of gold. And with understanding of how money works and understanding of how computer works. It also started to make sense to me when I read the Bitcoin white paper and then going to Bitcoin meetups talking to people who are like minded. And I think it further validates how Bitcoin will be a game changer when I was trying to build a software as a service. And trying to touch customer from Southeast Asia, and there was no payment provider like stripe that I could easily use. I contacted some local payment provider, and they say that, you know, you need to have like half a million dollars in your bank account for us to get the paperwork going. So I don't have that kind of money. And I don't have I'm just a developer just trying to start out and get this running. And sooner or later, they weren't interested. So I decided to start experimenting with Bitcoin as a form of payment. So I started building a peer to peer digital content marketplace, where people could upload digital content like e-book music, 3d render files, and then anyone who downloads it to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. And then that was my first experimentation. It didn't go anywhere. But it just helped me to understand how crypto really works and what sort of people that helped me along the way, and then later on, by sheer chance, through a mutual friend, I had a chance to meet Bobby who is currently my co-founder CoinGecko. There weren't many people who are interested in Bitcoin at the time, but it was quite refreshing to find people who resonate with you. And Bob kind of knew that Bitcoin is a new market and an opportunity to build something. So we're thinking that, you know, what can we do in this space, and one of the obvious thing to do was to probably do an exchange based in Malaysia, because at the time, I think every country had an exchange that serves the local market. So we thought like that could be a potential idea to work on. But it was just too many regulatory hurdles to get going. So we didn't think that that's something that we are good at. So we decided to go on a purely software play to data aggregation. And that was how we started off building CoinGecko, basically. Yeah.\n\n\nJACK: So let's just go back to the moment that you and Bobby met, because, that was the birth of a relationship that's now seven years long. Because that's how long CoinGecko has been around. When did you first meet Bobby, and how did you know you shared a interest to start a company, specifically in crypto? \n\nTM LEE: Yeah. So, I was basically working in a company in Singapore, and through a mutual friend, he somehow swing by to Singapore as well. And then they were saying that if the mutual friend is actually my, my CTO at an old company, and he was telling Bobby that, you know, there was a Malaysian guy as well, who is very much into bitcoin. And why don’t both of you chat, right? So instead of talking to Bobby, and we just exchanged contact, we never had the chance to dive deeper into bitcoin. And then we just talk online and just exchange information exchange ideas. And at one point, when I, when I left my job and go back to Malaysia, we both sat down together and say that, you know, we should really try to do something, right. Bobby, at the time was running a crypto newsletter, there was an experiment a time and my experiment was the peer to peer marketplace, right, and the peer to peer micro payment marketplace. And then both of us came together, you know, we should do something together like both of us have our own project, we should do something together. And we list down the thing that we want to work on like an exchange was one of it, maybe doing some mining. And eventually we drilled down to doing CoinGecko, right. So I think over that period of time, we sort of like saw that both of us are committed to the state, I bought our own project. And we sort of believe in how crypto may be bigger than it is at the time. And then we sort of have got to get in and do this as a side project. We, we didn't really expect anything from the market as well, we just wanted to build something that we thought was missing in this space, there wasn’t anyone who tracked crypto project based on developer activity, social media metric, public interest from Reddit. And so we wanted to just put the put this together, because both of us were sort of like trading alt coins at the time. And we thought like, this will be a good metric that we can use to evaluate whether an alt coin has potential or whether it would survive the test of time, because there was just many alt coins that were launched. And then after two to three weeks, they die off because there's no community behind it, there's no developer like pushing codes to it. So we thought this could be a good metric that we could use to gauge or these altcoins. Yeah. \n\nJack: And how long was it until the market noticed that what you were creating had a lot of value? So basically, how long did you keep it as a side project, until it became your main project?\n\nTM LEE: So not many people sort of understood what we were doing the first version of CoinGecko, most of the people in the market once pricing data, market cap volume, you know, all these market data that you see right now. But I think, what I mean, the things that we did caught certain people's attention, like, there was some researchers in some universities who reach out to us and say, hey, we would like to collaborate with you guys. You know, you guys have all this data, why don't we do a joint research together? So I think by doing this, we had a chance to meet with a couple of interesting people in the space that that doesn't just look at price wanted to look at fundamental data as well.\nBut I think over the years, we realized that market data is what people really want to see. And even then the crypto market was really small, like after the collapse of bitcoin price, because of the Mt. Gox collapse. The crypto market was really, really small, like people were leaving the stage, they didn't think that Bitcoin would work. You even got Bitcoin Core developers say that, you know, this wouldn't work, you know, I'm just gonna retire and not do this anymore. So we really don't know what we what we needed to do. At one point, we wanted to sell the website away, and move on to something else, because we will get like Silicon Valley VCs telling us that we are probably solving the wrong problem. These days, maybe not work with the info. So we really didn't know what we wanted to do, and then went to the start up the site, and we couldn't find anyone who was willing to buy it. And ever since then, I decided to just like, maybe just fix some bugs, or just continue running the site, as is and then just wait and see what happens. And then when 2017 came, we didn't do any marketing. But then we started to see a surge in traffic, like, our website grew like 10x, just by doing nothing, right. Our website was translated into like 10 to 20 languages, I believe, because we saw that the crypto movement was largely a global thing and not just a English speaking country thing and like the internet in the early days. So I think that got has a lot of traffic as well when the crypto market starts moving up. So ever since when the traffic that's going on, we asked ourselves, maybe we're onto something and then when it comes to 2018 we started hiring our first engineer which is a friend of mine to come in and fix things up, because as the market gets more and more crazy that we find our self, firefighting with bugs, firefighting with a support ticket and issues, and then from then onwards, we decided that it may not be a side project anymore, and we both decided on leaving our day jobs and focusing on it 100% and then move on from there. Yeah.\n\nDAVID: Right. And what's it like to sort of witness the cult following develop around CoinGecko?\n\nTM LEE:  Yeah, I think that has been quite recently. So when we started going in full time in 2018, we were sort of like player number four or five? Three to four or five I think. Not many people knew the CoinGecko brand. Not many people were using it. But we wanted to just solve a particular problem right now, what we're seeing is, there's a long tail of tokens or projects that do not get their pricing integrated and stuff like that. So that was our main focus, like trying to cover the long tail of tokens and make sure that information can be found. And then also trying to address some of the issues that were in the market at a time, like there were issues of exchanges doing wash trading, that you can't really believe all the volume you see, users visiting a competitor website, and they said that they tried to trade on this exchange, that is deemed to be the most liquid, but you can actually get the best price, right, because of all the wash trading that was going on. And there was a lot of issues that we see in the space. And we incrementally try to fix them. Same issue for DEFI when DeFi started off in the early years, our team members say that, you know, you should really integrate all the services that Uniswap Compound, because, you know, because they might one day become something big. And I didn't, I didn't really see that as well. But I knew that for the crypto space to grow, the decentralized movement needs to be there. Like we started off supporting all these DEXs and decentralized lending services as well, and provide as much information as we can there. And then when DeFi summer came, we realized that a lot of the things that we display on our website becomes useful to a lot of people. And then people start to use CoinGecko and consider an alternative player other than what they're currently using. I think that's all that helped us to grow our product, grow our brand as well. I would say that it's quite a lucky thing for us. And timing as well works on our side. Yeah. So I guess I for the longest time, we never saw itself growing that quickly. But the DEFI Summer helped us on to the launch. \n\nJACK: I think that's so crazy, back in 2016, your company was literally going underwater. There were VCs in Silicon Valley saying it wasn’t gonna work. And I guess that's something I’d like to talk about. What kept you going? Was it the curiosity to see where it could go, or was it the underlying passion to see it through to the end, whatever end that is?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, I think there's a few things. Number one is that the whole company and the whole product is bootstrapped by ourselves. So even up to today, we did not raise any VC funding. The VCs that we spoke to our main leader, we didn't really pitch to them exactly, like we're just sharing things that we do. And then we just want to get some feedback from them. And because it is bootstrap, and we are not pressured to, like exit, or raise another round, or have limited bandwidth, we could just continue running this with no pressure. So I think that was one of the reason why we could just say, you know, let's just continue doing this, given how the market sentiment was at a time, it doesn't cost anything to just continue running it like we can just keep the status quo. So that's the first one. The second one is, is not like as though the website is doing zero traffic, like there are traffic is not going in the pace that we like to do. It is still profitable. It was just a side project between me and Bobby. So the burn rate is really low. And we made a little bit of revenue here and there that we can just reinvest back to keep the site running. And then thirdly, is that I think both of us were very much into crypto at a time. And we saw that that is a space that we have advantage in because if you go into the FinTech industry, which is something that we were looking at as well at a time, you're fighting with incumbents like banks or technologies who serve that bill for for the bank for the last 20 years, but in crypto space because it's so young someone coming in and say that they have 10year’s experience, they're probably just, they're probably lying, right? Because the crypto space was only in less than 10 years at the time. So we thought that this is the state that we could potentially have an advantage in. And I would say that these three things allow us to continue running the site. And then just see what happened like both of us kind of knew that one day it would explode, we just don't know when,like it could take 10 years, 15 years, but time is on our side, where we could just keep running this as long as there's no VC pressuring it. So as long as we keep it profitable. So yeah, and what happened was, when the 2017 boom came, and then when we got out from the whoile boom in 2018, I think one of the lessons that we learned is that crypto is a cyclical thing. Which means that you can't really just throw money into a crypto project and expect it to grow, even if it's a bear market, right. So the thing is that from now on, like, what we see that, yeah, there's going to be ups and downs, you just got to get through the hard times and start building and make sure that you have enough bandwidth to last, the entire bear market and then when the bull market comes, then make sure that you're really well prepared to address the needs of the market. A lot of the companies that raise money in 2014, from VCs, some of them ended up burning up their runway before 2017 came. But if they held on until then, I think we will see a very different landscape today that most of these guys will probably still be in business and maybe come like one of the larger players in the space.\n\nJACK: And more generally, operating in a cyclical industry as a founder, how do you approach your psychological expectations? So operating in a bull run, you would probably go through a lot of enthusiasm as you see a lot of growth, but how about the bear markets? What sort of characteristics would you say that you had that helped you cope in this environment?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, I think the main, the main thing is that not to spread ourselves too thin. I think people get carried away typically in a bull market, right, because there's just so much demand for the things that you're doing. I think I'm seeing that even on our side right now, all the companies in this current bull cycle is that you probably want to just keep growing your team members, you want to expand your business line to meet the demands of the bull market. But what is very dangerous is that once the bull cycle ends, then you are left with all these services that maybe people don't no longer want to use, and you have more manpower than you actually need. So I guess for us, it's more of a balancing act to ensure that we grow modestly, that we don't grow aggressively that for example, the bull market comes you don't want to like 5x 10x your team size, maybe like 2x 3x and you know, just incrementally grow from there. So I think there's one key thing because you don't want to end up with a huge burn rate eventually, when the bull cycle ends. So that’s the first one, maintaining your focus and your man power. Second one is when a bear market does come, then how do you do to stay alive, right? And how do you keep the team going? I think the key thing is to not address the mainstream market, like when the bear market comes, the people who are left in the bear market are passionate users, users who are in it for the long term. And what we what we end up doing is mingling with all these community, the passionate users, and trying to solve all these problems that they're facing. And then just keep building and building and building which is what we've been doing in the last bear cycle into 2020. And that helped us become more prepared when the bull cycle happens. So actually, if you ask me, I think I prefer the bear market times. Because we can just focus on building and not having to be distracted by where the market is going. And like right now, our team is just like, under the water, like we're just constantly trying to meet the demands of the market and we are not able to properly focus on the things that we really want to do. We have to probably wait until the market corrects itself always do to get there. So yeah, I would say it's a balancing act like not to spread ourselves too thin during good times. Yeah.\n\nDAVID: Right and talk about that more. So how do you cope with the kind of stress that's imposed by the success?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah. I think some of the issues that I face personally is one part is, you know where you want to get to. Like I think I see where crypto is headed like this. Going to get into a world where the decentralized world will probably coexist with the centralized world for a while until the market force decides which one is much more efficient or which one is better off for the use case. And there's just so much that we want to do on our side, we want all the features that we want to build to cater to the decentralized economy of the future. But then, again, as I mentioned, that we don't want to spread ourselves too thin. And so we also try to avoid wasting VC money, when and when we want to just grow modestly. Obviously, having a large team and having large amount of capital will allow you to get to that goal that you that you see as a vision. But again, if you fall into that trap, then you may not hit that goal, because of all the ups and downs that you have to go through to get there. So I think the hardest part for me is staying focus and making sure that we worry about the immediate problem that is today, or tomorrow, rather than the problem that we're going to face a week or a month later. So it's very, very easy to get distracted by all the issues that you face, a month later or a year later. But the most important thing is to focus on the immediate problem, because by solving that, then your days gets easier and easier, which you can then slowly focus on the bigger picture. Yeah, so I think that's like the key issue on my side, like making sure that I stay sane with all the to-dos and all the points that I need to solve on a day to day basis. Before going after the big picture. Granted, it is a bear market, then it's much easier to solve the bigger picture. But yeah, that and also try to de stress as well. I like going for a walk, going for a cycle. I know right now is COVID season, which makes it a little bit difficult to do that. But I think these are much needed, things that they need to do to stay focused. And I realized that sometimes you work too much. But if you take a little bit of time off, just for some outdoor activity, you tend to be much more productive, even with less time on Your Side. Yeah.\n\nJACK: Right. So something that you've been implementing is to take time away from the computer. And to spend a little bit more time on yourself?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, that and yeah, everyone needs to find what works for them. Like everyone has different ways of handling with stress or finding their own time off. But for myself is going outdoors. At one point I like doing some cooking, meditation works as well. So everyone has different methods, but just got to find what works for you. \n\nDAVID: Right, and you mentioned interacting with VCs. For someone who might not have had that interaction before, what’s it kind of look like?\n\nTM LEE:  Yeah, so I guess, like, at the beginning, we didn't really pitch to VC directly, because we wanted to keep it as a bootstrap company. And also like for myself, I'm a very, I'm a huge fan of DHH. And Jason Freid from Base Camp, who sort of like pushes the mantra of bootstrapping your product, rather than, you know, swing for the fans and raise money, which is also how we are running CoinGecko right now. Basically, we are bootstraped. And when we had the chance to talk to VC is mainly more of like a casual chat, like the sharing of what we do. And I think what I'm seeing in most of what they're looking for is really for companies that are fast growing. So when we share, like our ideas of slow growth. And also focusing on the problems that we're trying to build, which is an Information Portal, making sure that users get the crypto data that they want, at, at a first glance, it doesn't sound like an idea that can 10x because you're not going to be able to capitalize on the transaction of the user. I think if you look at the crypto space right now, exchanges are in the best position to make the most revenue like Coinbase recently filed their as one listing and 95% of their revenue comes from transaction fees. So I think that generally from the sentiment I'm getting is that there's a general push towards us going to the operating exchange or doing some sort of payments. But again, I think being a Bootstrap company, and also based on looking at the advantage that we have, we wanted to keep it the way we are we want to run the company in a way that we think will be happy running it for 10 years or 15 years, right. So it's very much conflict with what the VCs are looking for. And I guess that is a why until today. We never ended up raising from VCs. And then recently, we started talking to a few as well, although we are not in immediate need are actively looking to raise, but it's always good to just bounce some ideas to see that. Maybe there's something that makes sense for us to do. But I guess, because we want to run the company in a way, we will like to run for the next few years. We never see that pressure to raise from VC. And yeah, yeah.\n\nJACK: \nIt feels like once you get VC funding, it's no longer just up to you and the co-founder as the direction of the company. I guess in some sense you become boxed in because you have to meet the expectations of what the VC expects out of their investment. And going back to your stress mitigation techniques, I guess that would probably also lean into something that also reduces stress, not taking VC funding would allow you to run the business how you would like, just as you said. But when you do see your company doing so well, how does that stress of success play into your mindset as someone who focuses on the routines and day to day activities? How about going to events like the Forbes 30 Under 30? Is that a huge distraction?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, I think you're spot on that. Some of the , there's a lot of things that we're getting a lot of inbound requests and stuff like that, which may be deemed as a distraction. So I guess like for us, every time when we ask ourselves, what is it that we want to do is that we try to pick the one that could move, move the needle. I think that applies throughout the whole organization as well, not just us, like, what is it that we can do to move the needle? I mean, we just started out CoinGecko, what marketing channel that we can use to move the needle and even up to today, we still ask myself the same question. And of course, your options gets more and more limited as you grow. Because you're not you're used to seeing a company, or the old methods that you use to move the needle doesn't work anymore. So I would say that, the thing is that myself and Bobby and I both of us are also very much heavily involved in operations. We're like, we don't just do planning, but we also do operations, like even up to today, I still write code. So you're right, there's always going to be this issue. There are some days that I want to not have any distraction at all. So I can push out some important piece of code that will move the product like one step further. And then there are some days which I'm okay with taking calls throughout the whole days, and not quite not because I think all these calls will help us into a certain direction. Right? So I guess it's like teasing the days and choosing the engagements and a request that you think will be beneficial for the product as a whole. So, so I would say that, yes, it's, it's gonna be very difficult. But you have to ask yourself, in everything that you agree on, what is it that move the needle at the end of the day.\n\nJACK: Yeah, so with every decision, there is a sacrifice that’s made right? An opportunity cost. So what are some of the personal sacrifices that you made to allow CoinGecko to become a success?\n\nTM LEE: I think it has been generally, it has gone generally quite well, for me, I would say. So what happened was, the nice thing about crypto is that to start a crypto company, you never had to be in the valley. So I never had to find myself relocating away from my family. I'm actually still in Malaysia and still staying in Asia, my family is here. And I could run the business from here as well. So I'm not giving up on family to some extent. And then even my wife is very supportive with the things that I do. So I'm also not giving up on that as well. So I guess, like what I gave up was, perhaps the opportunity costs when we were starting at CoinGecko, because at that time, it wasn't very clear to us. Whether it will be a success or not, and we are spending like three years on the side project, just hoping that one day it might become something and then we will also trying out other ideas and we had our day job. Whereas if you think conversely, you could potentially be going to a VC raising like, couple of million dollars and working on a project, which you could potentially make it scale within one to two years. So I think that was in hindsight, one of the potential opportunity costs. But looking back now, I think, looking at where CoinGecko is today, I think he has been quite a good path for us to take at this point in time. So I think the only issue right now is looking forward from now what would be the sacrifices that have to make, there might be some with regards to the direction the company or even a direction of, of where I'm going, but I hope that I could make incremental decision again, to ensure that I don't sacrifice too much as the company scales up.  \n\nDAVID: Right, and maybe take us there. What does the grind look like at CoinGecko?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah. So I think that the biggest operational problem right now is meeting the demand of making sure that we cover all the token projects and all the exchanges that come to the market, I mean, that's the most immediate need. So even right now, you're seeing that DEFI projects gets replicated on many different chains. And then every chain. You know, they want to be integrated on CoinGecko. And then there are people out there traders who also want all the information, we want to try to ensure that we cover all these projects. And but that involves manpower on our side to solve a research on all these tokens, which is knowledge exchange to ensure that information is correct. And then on the engineering side, we have to ensure that everyone knows how to integrate all these different DEXs, there is more, on my end, also doing a lot of research and development for all these new chains, because not everyone in our company is well versed with how blockchain works, the smart contract, and how all these smart contract data being indexed by all the different providers to my site is really trying to research and anticipate as well like how all these can be implemented, and then passing it down to all the team members to implement and integrate them at scale. And then you always have to be like a week or a month forward, to anticipate what's coming up. And then during that groundwork as well ahead of time, so that I can then pass it off to a team member to integrate them. So there's a lot of bodies operational and anticipation going on, to make sure that CoinGecko continues to stay ahead of the curve in terms of the offerings that we have for the market. I think at this point in time with the bull market, even for the support request sign, we're getting like hundreds to maybe thousands a day, which we're struggling to keep up as well. So yeah, operational bottlenecks is something that it's a huge problem for us at the point.\n\nJack: And I guess with the growth that you’ve seen, your role would have transitioned away from just you and Bobby creating a startup, into more of a leadership role. How have you found that transition? Is that something that you're naturally accustomed to? Or is that something that you’ve had to work on?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, I think I think for myself, I, I had to work on it. Because we we've been running CoinGecko for the early part of the first three years, and the entire code base was written by myself. So I have the tendency to want to do everything, to write all the code, and then when I see ,okay we are going to integrate an exchange, I will go ahead and figure out how to do it and integrate it. So the tendency to do it is there but I realized, and I always have to remind myself that I can't be doing everything. And if I tried to do everything, I'm, I'm probably going to become the bottleneck for the whole company. Because there's always someone else in the company who is able to figure this out. And then if they go through the hard way, they won’t be able to figure out and become well versed in the state eventually. So I always have to remind myself that I need to delegate, if I could help them be effective at their work, I could help them to do some research. But ultimately, I should try to pass on the responsibility to them. And then something that, you know, I always had to remind myself, not just for the tech side, but even for the marketing or product in general like because initially it was just to have it right. So we ended up doing everything but over the years. It is better off if we become a facilitator to help everyone be effective at what they do. Because they have better ideas than I do. Yeah. In the grand scheme of things.\n\nJACK: Just going to the future now. What exactly do you see CoinGecko growing into? I've seen you’ve released a couple of educational pieces, with the new releases, such as ‘How to Bitcoin’. Is that something you’re looking to capitalise on?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah, I would say that the grand vision that we have is, we see that a day where everything that can be tokenized will be tokenized. In that sense, there's probably going to be millions of tokens out there, representing all kinds of assets like people already tokenizing their time with tokens, people are tokenizing a DAO, people are tokenizing real estate assets. So there'll be millions of tokens out there. And the goal of CoinGecko is really to aggregate and organize all this information in a way that people can understand. What are the features? And what are the things that we need to do to get there, we are not exactly sure yet. Because these are things that we decide on a day to day basis, depending on where the market goes. And also the direction of where the market is headed. Because we don't want to fall into a trap where we built something too far ahead of his time. We have made up of all these mistakes before and we want to try to avoid that. So we got to the book, I think we did see ourselves as an education hub. And the book was a starting point for us. So the how to DeFi book was actually an experiment where we saw a missing gap that we understood what DEFI was. But there is no single point of reference that you can get all the information in one place. Like all the information about how to use Uniswap, how to use Compound, they're all like spread across the internet. And we wanted to just combine them into one place where a beginner can come in and understand DEFI from A to Z and put it into a book and the traction has been great. And when DeFi summer happened, like you got even better, and people started to, you know, enjoy the book in a way that they can dive into DEFI in one sitting. So there was a first concept that worked really well. And we wanted to steal that because all the other topics. So naturally, Bitcoin was the second topic we decided to go with, because there will be huge interest from people outside of crypto. And so yeah, definitely, we're going to steal more on the education side of things. Our analysts are working on upscaling themselves as well, in terms of trying to produce research content, I'm sure you have seen some of our quarterly reports that we send out in the past years. So those are generally all the puzzle pieces that we want to eventually build up into an education platform for them and also for people within the space that wants to keep up with the industry because the space just moves so quickly. And our job is really to organize and aggregate information as we get towards a world where everything that can be tokenized will be tokenized. So yeah, that's the vision.\n\nDAVID: Right. So maybe just unpack that for a bit. So what is your vision and how did you arrive at that conclusion?\n\nTM LEE: I think that happened. Post 2017. Prior to 2017 I was mainly a Bitcoin maximalist maybe, if you will. And then when, when after 2017 happened, you know, there's all kinds of crazy projects and even the bear market happened as well. I tried to keep an open mind and probably look at, you know, what, what are the points that people are trying to solve with blockchain, I'm just going to put my bias away. And I started to conclude that maybe Bitcoin is not the silver bullet to everything, like it cannot solve all the problems out there. Which is why we need alternative services that are good at certain things, which also allows other people to innovate and build on top of that, which is what you see with Ethereum. Over the years, it has its own shortcomings, but it has attracted a lot of smart people into this space as well, to further innovate and further build more interesting use cases. And then with the advent of NFT, which is what I saw in 2018. I knew that you are not just restricted to just currencies. You also got people tokenizing physical assets or virtual asset. And then you have the incentive system at play as well to make sure that all actors behave in a certain way. So think like when  I saw all this missing pieces that at one point I thought was impossible for us to achieve, for example, a DAO and tokenize a smart contract and or whether you're seeing how it slowly gain adoption within a certain small group of people and slowly skill up mainstream, it further validates to me that potentially this will be one of the future that we will live in. In a sense that there could be DAO governing a network rather than a public centralized company. It could be Token that use to incentivize people to act in a certain way of using shares or equity. So I think over the years and seeing what people are building and the attraction that is getting and the kind of people that you attract for the value that, that kind of future that I think we will reach.\n\nJack: And as we move into the future, how can we keep up to date with yourself and CoinGecko?\n\nTM LEE: Yeah. So you can check out our website at coingecko.com. I think, the navigation and part will allow you to explore the entire facet of the site. There are some features that are maybe much hidden which could be useful for some people, but a few features to explore there. We are also on various community groups, on Discourse, Telegram, uh, I think our team members are there as well, and there's always some chatter going on there, not just us, but the members of the community as well. So I think these are some of the best ways to connect with us and yeah. Feel free to share any feedback, suggestions or, anything you want to discuss about the crypto space. Our team members are always ready to answer them. Yeah.\n\nJACK: Thanks for coming on TM Lee, really appreciate it.\n\nTM LEE: Thank you. Thanks. Thanks for having me.\n\n\n"}},{"node":{"captivate_link":"https://player.captivate.fm/episode/0d3e62a4-deaa-48c0-b2b1-a2e279229a5d","description":"Nick Mudge is an Ethereum blockchain developer who prides himself on seeing around corners before others have even looked up. He has written several ERC and EIP standards that seek to improve Ethereum’s efficiency, most notably EIP-2535, otherwise known as Diamonds. It was with this EIP that he became the CTO of Pixelcraft to work on Aavegotchi, one of the more complex NFTs of Ethereum.\n\nIn this episode Nick reveals why he fell prey to the gravitational pull of Ethereum and discusses the logistics of writing an EIP and how he put EIP-2535 to work when building Aavegotchi. With experience as both a CEO and a developer, Nick dissects the opportunity costs of choosing between these two positions and explains why he prefers to choose the latter. As a developer Nick has had the opportunity to work on the frontier landscape that is Ethereum development.\n\nHear his story, in #HighDefinition.\n\nFind Nick on Twitter - @mudgen\n\nStay Connected with High Definition:\n\nTwitter - @hd_eth​\n\nWebsite -highdefinition.eth.link\n\nEmail - hello@highdefinition.media","episode":7,"duration":34,"guest":"Nick Mudge","img":{"formats":{"medium":{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/medium_Nick_Mudge_Thumbnail_Website_c2997ca7d5/medium_Nick_Mudge_Thumbnail_Website_c2997ca7d5.png"}}},"recorded_on":null,"slug":"nick-mudge","release_date":"2021-04-07","youtube_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDj0N6Af0gM","transcript":"JACK: Hi Nick, thank you so much for coming on High Definition, it's a pleasure to have you here, could we just start off by telling us a little bit about yourself and your background.\n\nNICK: yeah sure so I started well I've been programming for a long time I started programming websites and like back ends of websites and then later I got into writing custom software for manufacturing companies just like data analytics charts graphs things like that and I did that for a number of years. Then i got interested in Ethereum and Blockchains and so I got into that and just started reading things and learning and I really started my journey in 2018 as far as like learning solidity and smart contracts and I  so I was really interested in being like on the forefront like what's the leading edge of technology I wanted to do that and at the time the ERC 721 token standard was being discussed and hashed out and written and tested and so I got very familiar with that standard for making NFT's and you know and I started like writing contracts around NFT's and  then looked around to see what I could do and there was this idea of composable NFT's where you could have an NFT that holds or owns an other NFT or could also hold and own an ERC20 token and Matt Lockyer had written some blog posts about this and started a project and a new standard called ERC998. So then I got involved that was just like just starting and so I got involved with that standard and helped write it and start implementing the reference implementation for that and so that was good but at the time I was writing that I ran into a problem where if you have a smart contract that implements an NFT, that implements ERC721 but also implements ERC998 there's different ways to compose there's different ways for an NFT to own another NFT and so I wanted to do an implementation where it was possible for NFT to possess her own other NFT's in multiple ways but the but the main thing about this is that i ran into the smart contract size limitation where a smart contract on Ethereum can only be about 24 kilobytes in bytecode size and so i couldn't do what I wanted to do and so then I started looking for a solution to well how can you have a smart contract be big yeah and so that led me into finding a solution for that which was called the transparent contract standard like your ERC 1538.  So I worked on this solution I found a way that you could have one Ethereum contract address that acted like one big contract it actually utilized could utilize multiple other contracts using the delegate call up code and you could also upgrade it so you can have like a big contract and you can add to it later or remove to remove or replace things but then it but it has caused other problems like okay you could have this big upgradable contract but now you need you want to have transparency because one of the nice things about smart contracts and Ethereum is that you can see the source code of the contracts and they can be verified so you can share the source code matches a contract and so I wanted that same transparency for big contracts that can be upgraded. So then I that's really where the standardization came in there for you know emitting events and functions that could provide information about what was in the contract. So anyway so that was done and I released this the standard there and some  developers and companies started using this this standard and then that was so that was good and then and then about it and then about a year later or so or a couple years later there was OpenZeppelin from someone from OpenZeppelin, they have something else that called transparent. It's like a transparent proxy thing. It sort of clashed with the name of the standard I had, which was, you know, the transparent contract your standard, I believe, and, and so I needed it, I needed a different name and I had so for why do you need a different name, and so then I came up with the name of the Diamond standard. And I kind of came up with that name, because I discovered that this pattern to make a big contract upgradable, there's another really big benefit to it. And that was that it happened to be able to organize contracts well, it was really a system for isolating functionality that goes together, and being able to share data between the that those things, it created this level of modularization. And so anyways, the diamond, you know, this, this, this concept that you have these different aspects of a diamond, different facets, kind of applied to this pattern, because you had, you had one diamond, one contract, one address, but it had different aspects. And you could, you could change these. I know, you know, people say that, you know, a diamond is a very hard thing, and you cannot change a diamond. But that's actually not true because diamonds are chain, they're, they're cut, and they're cut and given new faucets. So they actually, actually are, you know, you take you know, your original diamond stone or whatever, and you cut it, and then you give it the shape that you want. Even though it's a hard thing, but you know, I guess, you know, once slowly the contracts are actually kind of, they're hard too like, like, if you're not supposed to change them, then they don't change. You know, so it's.\n\nJACK:  Yeah, definitely, I've got a question in there just about EIP’s in writing ERC standards and whatnot. What's the actual process look like? Do you have to be allowed by someone to write something? Or is it more so just you can, if you're interested, you can write whatever you want, get community feedback, and go from that?\n\nNICK: Yeah, so it's a really open and kind of include all collaborative thing that I found. There's a, there's a document and it's called EIP1, right. And it lays out the proper, you know, how EIP’s work and this sort of process and the steps and things. But really, anybody can, the kind of general procedure, I'll top my head is that you know, you have an idea for standard, something that could be useful to others, that would benefit from software integration, or interoperability. So the first step is posting the idea, somewhere, like on a on a forum, or on GitHub, issue - where the EIPs are, and give an outline of what it is and what it was, you know, giving information and stuff and start getting some feedback.\nYou know, and maybe you don't get any feedback. So then you go look at some other related standards, and you find people giving feedback there. And you contact those people. And you ask them for feedback, you get to go reach out and find people that and get feedback. And then of course, doing an implementation of your idea is important. And then acting on people's speed. You just kind of evolved it. But it's really, you don't have to ask anyone anyone's permission. Just get started and get going.\n\nDAVID: What was it initially that sparked your interest in Ethereum in the first place. Obviously you started working on technical issues and began developing solutions to the problems that you had but what was it that initially interested you about building on Ethereum.\n\nNICK: Well I think very initially like 2017 I was seeing in the news things about bitcoin and like how the price was going up a lot and I knew bitcoin was software I'm a software developer and I like money and so I just so I thought it was interesting and then with the Ethereum you know this the idea of programmable money was interesting and that you know you could as a developer I could I could create things that did different things with money was interesting and then and then the idea that I could create things having to do with ownership of other things besides money like it could be ownership of art and you talk about what's coming next I think that NFT's you know can represent other things they can represent you know your title to have ownership of things like your car and ownership of other things. Anyway so these ideas got interested in that as a developer you could do I could do that and I didn't you know and also I didn't have to like I could just be a developer and work on these things i didn't have to be a business person I didn't have to have a team of different kinds of people, while I think it's good to do all that stuff just as a developer you can just seemed like it was a it was also a new area so these things programmable money I like that.\n\nJACK: Yeah but also like prior to Ethereum you did have your own companies so what's the enticement to just be a developer rather than also being a CEO for example for you personally.\n\nNICK: Like being just a developer versus a CEO or something like that?\n\nJACK: Yeah.\n\nNICK:I don't know, I think it's a well okay so I'd say it's I think it has to do with for me has to do with kind of a personal freedom where if you're just if you're developer if you're if you're just a developer on your own you really have a lot of freedom on what you work on and so that's what that's what I like I don't know like I don't know, I think it's just different as developer you get to program stuff but as an executive you know you have to hire and you have to train you have to write more documentation i think that's a good thing too that's a good game to play I think if you're going to build a project a successful project you have to do that like if you know if you want it to be your project and you have to own it and that means that means you know having developers and having PR people and having like doing all of that.\n\nJACK: Yeah, and is there a monetary incentive attached to that? Or is it more so just out of the general prosperity of Ethereum? Which is why you'd be interested in doing it?\n\nNICK: Um, yeah, um, yeah, it's, there's no like direct financial incentive on it. There might be reasons for people to doing it. Like, like it, you know, there's engine that made ERC 1155 they needed a standard for their own company, but they might also want, you know, they're going to be, you know, build something that's profitable for them using that standard, but they might also want other people to adopt it, because then they can integrate with what they're doing. I think they, you know, there could be some financial benefits for some standards. But I don't know of any, like, direct. I don't know. I think it's a good way to get in connection with people in the space and get to, you know, meet people and start building and you know, interesting things. \n\nJACK: And that was a good way for you to sort of enter the community. Did you make a lot of friends in that process and lifelong business partners in that sense?\n\nNICK: Yeah, I I've met. Yeah, I made some good connections with people that I respect and I'm glad to know and that shared good information with or like Matt Lockyer is one of them. And so there's some other developers that I'm glad that I've met and associated with.\n\nDAVID: How'd you meet Matt?\n\nNICK: Well, Matt, when I was interested in non-fungible tokens in 2018, and I, he wrote a blog post about composable, non-fungible tokens and ERC 998. And he was starting standard for that. And so I met him through that, like he started and then I, I started writing a bunch of code about what about his ideas and we connected up that way. \n\nJACK: Nice, it seems like that that sort of slides perfectly into PixelCraft and Aavegotchi in that sense. Aavegotchi uses the EIP 2535, which is your diamond standard. How exactly does that standard benefit Aavegotchi? And I guess what is Aavegotchi as well?\n\nNICK: Yeah, so what happened there is Dan and Jessie, which are the founders of, of PixelCraft, and Aavegotchi, they were going to build this, this, this idea of this, of these NFT's that were powered DEFI powered, they could hold ERC 20 tokens and interest bearing ERC 20 tokens and they want to build a game. So it was like game plus, like art, plus, Defi. And they say there's a lot, that's a lot right there. But they also knew that they wanted to have an expanding game, it's like, they want to add more and more functionality at in the future. And so they needed something that could expand over time, and, you know, be upgraded, and that could still be organized. So it's not like, like, like a mess. So, they found about they found out about the diamond standard and thought that, you know, this can help them with that they contacted me, first they want me being an advisor, and you know, to help them, you know, create a smart contract system that use the diamond standards to give them what they wanted. But then you know, talking with them and seeing what they're doing, I really liked what they were doing. And so I wanted to join and so we looked at that possibility, and that happened.\n\nJACK: Cool. \n\nNICK: So yeah, so I've connected with people who want to build smart contract systems at a diamond standard would help. And that's how I worked on projects and met people. \n\nJACK: Yeah. And then, I guess with Aavegotchi, how does that differ from a traditional NFT? Traditional in the sense of, you know, just a JPEG or art piece? What sort of other factors does that have?\n\nNICK: Yeah, good. So look, let's look at some examples of that. So one, one thing that's different is that, you know, traditional NFT is, you know, like an implementation of ERC 721 or ERC 1155. And so they have a token, they have a token and a contract and then they have like a separate art piece that like, as you said, like a JPEG or SVG or something that's stored off chain in some other system. One thing that’s different with Aavegotchi, we don't store the art off chain and some other system, it's stored in this in the same contract as the token itself. So everything is on chain. So that's, that's one thing that's different. So like, yeah, so you're when you have your Aavegotchi, you have the art to all on a smart, same smart contract. \n\nJACK: Yep. And then also with Aavegotchi, part of its rarity comes from your A tokens. So the tokens that you that you put inside of it, is that correct as well?\n\nNICK: It does, it does hold all the tokens which does affect the value of it, so and then their interest bearing so if you have an Aavegotchi, it's got some A tokens in it, and it's just, it's just it's going to increase. If you're just looking at it from a Defi aspect, then it's going to increase in value because it's, it's holding the A tokens. So when an Aavegotchi is created, it's given a set of random traits. It's like six random traits. And some of these traits, their values are more rare than others. And so that's really how the rarity of Aavegotchi is created as is, you know, because you have like spookiness and you have aggressiveness, brain size, and some the very high, like each trait is a value from zero to 99. And extremes like zero and 99 are very rare numbers to get to get. And so that's really how an Aavegotchi’s rarity is on its traits, does it have rare traits? It has rare traits then it's rare.\nSo, yeah, and that that again, that functionality is on the blockchain all its game mechanics are on the blockchain there. So one thing that's different is that an Aavegotchi can hold other tokens, it can hold ERC 721, and we tend to call those wearables or items. So, you know, if you if you have an Aavegotchi, you can put a hat on your Aavegotchi. And then, you know, when you look on the on the website, it's wearing a hat, but it's actually in the contract that that token is actually owned by the Aavegotchi. So if you sold your Aavegotchi, all its wearables, and everything would go with it. \n\nJACK: Cool. And there's Aavegotchi DAO as well, so the governing body for the project. How does that DAO interact with PixelCraft? Is, like competing governance in that sense, or is it a symbiotic relationship? How did that come about?\n\nNICK: Yeah, so I'd say it's symbiotic. For certain decisions, PixelCraft doesn't know the answer totally, or doesn't even want to make the decision. So like, and it's just like, well, we should you know, if it's a big, if it's like, also, if it's a big question about the project, and the community should vote on it. So like, an example is, we had our first haunt, which is basically our first token, first sale of Aavegotchi, and it went out, it sold really fast, like, in a couple of minutes, and a lot of people didn't get Aavegotchis and so those questions, should we have another haunt right away? Or should we wait? And so we had a vote for that, that's an example of a vote like, well, let let's let the DAO, you know, vote and determine are we gonna have a second, you know, haunt right away or not, which decided that it was going to have one soon, so, so there won't be a second one coming.\n\nJACK:  As a CTO, does that to some extent, concern you having some of these decisions, like not made internally and made by the DAO? Or is that something that you embrace and accept? \n\nNICK: I embrace and embrace and accept, I think there's definitely leadership involved. Really, I look to Dan and Jesse as sort of as they enter they big part of the community. And they, they, they're they make decisions about PixelCraft. And so I've really liked how they've led things and decided and so I'm pretty comfortable with how things have gone. \n\nDAVID: Right And maybe, I guess, for someone who like you has been so involved in writing some of the, the standards and the implementations of NFT's to begin with, It must be pretty crazy seeing the adoption over the last kind of three or four months. What's that been like for you?\n\nNICK: It's been fun. Because Oh, because like I started like this kind of stuff In 2018. I made a one of like a website and a contract called Mokens where people could create, like their own NFT's in 2018. And like, at that time, it was like crypto winter and like, very little, like, people involved and like very little interest relatively. But then Now then, in the last few months, there's been so much interest and so much hype about it. So it's, it's nice to see that it's cloud that's coming that's, you know, really growing up and doing well. It's been fun.\n\nDAVID: Right, and what would you say to someone who's building through a bear market like you were?\n\nNICK: I think it's just, put your head down and build things that you think are going to that will provide value that that will be fun and great. And I think maybe I could be wrong. I think the trick in the bear market is figuring out what will be valuable to people like because that's because you could in a bear market, you could be building something that's not very like you don't have a lot of visitors like a lot of traffic or a lot of interest yet but you will have and you know, when it when things you know, get better. So, as long as I think as long as you're working on something that could be useful, then just put your head down and build and there's, you know, in a bear market, it's more quiet. There's a lot there's a lot less distractions. So that's a good, that's a good time to concentrate on implementation and building. \n\nJACK: Then how about the bull market? What are the tips and tricks there?\n\nNICK: I'd say, have fun, I'd say, I guess there's a temptation to go real fast. And just to make sure you do things, right, that you things are secure. You know, I also got to implement and listen to people, there's a lot of there's a lot of people. So listen, find out, you know, what people like, what they don't like, pay attention to what's going on, I think. I think that's those are good things. \n\nJACK: Yeah. And I guess, like equally as, like equally to the come up of NFT's is like the rise of layer2 as well. And one of the other projects that you've contributed to was Quickswap. So I guess where does that sit in your timeline of, of your, your work in Ethereum? And why did you decide to also help that project?\n\nNICK: Yeah, so last year, I wanted to build an exchange on Polygon. Yeah, like a cryptocurrency exchange token exchange. And because I could see that the gas costs were, I didn't want to pay the gas costs on Ethereum and even last year. And so, you know, and I liked I like Polygon, is, you know, when I, once I dug into their, like, their bridge, their contract code, start working with them, I liked them. And I could just see the potential of building things on Polygon, because of that, because of the low gas cost is like, even last year, so I was working on exchange. And I wanted to, like, build an exchange, like Uniswap, but had built in governance token into it. And some other things, I'll tell you that story. And so then, but then there was another developer, Sameep, and a marketing agency that wanted to they wanted to go with something like faster, or they didn't want to wait for development. And so then, so then, so Quickswap became just a clone of released a smart contracts that became a clone of Uniswap, which was a good decision, which was, which was really good, because, you know, Uniswap, has already had gone through security audits, and has already been tested. And do we need a smart contract code is really good. So we just didn't make any changes to it, then that would be good. And that turned out to be really well. And so then I, you know, I think Quickswap kind of went along last year. And then and then what happened is that Aavegotchi was gonna launch on Ethereum in like January, and but before we're going to launch, it was like the gas fees went really high. And it just became pretty clear that it was not gonna be good, be good a launch of Aavegotchi on Ethereum. So we pivoted to, to Polygon. And Aavegotchi has the ghost token, and we have staking for ghosts to provide liquidity. And, and we were using Uniswap pool for in connection with our staking and we needed a new exchange. And so it just, it just became pretty obvious that we should use Quickswap. And since I was already familiar with the Quickswap team and team and what it was and everything. And so then there was a big marketing campaign with Aavegotchi with a Quickswap and Matic to move the, like $5 million with the liquidity of a ghost on Uniswap over to over to Polygon. And then that was really, so we did that. And that was like really successful. And then a lot of other projects wanted to do similar with Quickswap. And so a whole bunch, you know, Quickswap went from like 300,000 liquidity to 100 million liquidity in like, I don't know, a few weeks. \n\nJACK: Yeah, that's that growth is yeah, it's exponential. That's, that's wild. Yeah, from like a developer's point of view. What do you think about forking code? So like you said, you use the Uniswap codebase to build Quickswap verse developing your own code. And then also, I guess, what do you think about Uniswap v3 with their licensing?\n\nNICK: Right, um, well, I like to write new code. Like I love to make something original. But I also think that some existing code and solutions are really good to look at because you can learn a lot from existing smart contract, implementation. So, so I guess I like them, you know, sometimes you need to get things done faster, you don't have time to implement and test something new and get it, you know, really looked at well for security. So, um, so like, yeah. So I guess I, so I like this. I like it all on that. And then for Uniswap, version three, I read some about it. I think their licensing makes sense. I think it's like that, you know, you can't you can't use your code for three years. And then what's after three years is open source. I think that makes sense. Kind of makes sense to me, because then. Yeah, because, you know, then, in three years from now, they'll probably want to release version four of Uniswap.\n\nDAVID: Right, I guess it's an interesting question. On the one hand, you know, Ethereum, one thing Ethereum enables, and any kind of permissionless chain enables is permissionless development. So do you think that it's kind of artificial? Or, you know, does it kind of feel against the ethos of the space of trying to introduce something that's proprietary about an open source code base?\n\nNICK: Um, I think, yeah, to some degree, I guess a question I have is, are they still letting people see the source code, even though It's proprietary I'm not sure. Do you know, if they're letting people still they're still publishing the source code. They're just saying that it's licensed. \n\nDAVID: I guess if the contracts are on chain, though, they're on chain. Not exactly sure on that.\n\nNICK: Yeah. So I think I think that that makes a difference. If they're still releasing the source code. I think that's good. Because then like, atleast developers can review it and know what, like how, Uniswap is working. And, you know, I'll verify for themselves that that is secure if they want to, but if they're their innate, they're, hiding the verified source code of the contract of some of the contracts. I think that goes more against the ethos of Ethereum, you know but yeah, yeah.\n\nJACK:  Yeah. It's, it seems like you spend a lot of your time developing ahead of the curve. Like we said, at the start of this, this episode, you became enticed by looking at what's next? And how you can sort of move Ethereum into that direction. So currently, what are you sort of thinking about building in the future for, you know, the next phase of Ethereum?\n\nNICK: Yeah, um, that's a good question. I think that, you know, for a while I've been like, I'm working a lot with Aavegotchi and existing stuff that I haven't really gotten a chance to, to think and work on something that I think is like, going to be the next thing, I think. I guess what one thing is, is that now we have NFT's now. Now there's, there's, there's an interaction between them. As you know, your traditional NFT is like kind of this static thing, once it's there, it's an art piece, you can transfer it you can, you can sell or buy it, selling buying is just another kind of transfer. So an Aavegotchi takes that further where now NFT's are, you know, like, you can love game mechanics, like, like with the Aavegotchi we want to make a lot of mini games, where you play this game and your traits give you an edge or are they are they're a liability, depending on what game you play. And, again, Aavegotchi integrates with Chainlink towards randomness, you know, it's using Polygon, it's using all for interest bearing tokens. And so like, you know, connecting with these different projects. It's using by economy by the economy for gasless transactions. Yeah, so I guess that, you know, more, you know, I can see that there's be more interact more connectedness and interactivity with NFT's. That's what Aavegotchi is doing. And so I think that's, that's more out there than just your static NFT's. \n\nJACK: Yeah. And with all those integrations, like what's the process behind that? Do you simply just, like talk to the team? Or like, how do you integrate with all of these platforms?\n\nNICK: Yeah, so we, we generally have a plan of like features or development that we're going to be doing and we'll reach out, you know, Dan or Jesse. They really kind of establish relationships with these other projects. And they do really good with that. And then there's a lot of blog posts that talk about what's coming and what we're, what's being done. So it's a lot of communication both with the community and with different people.\n\nJACK:  yeah cool and so just moving forward where can people find you see what you're up to are you going to be writing other EIP’s ERC’s? \n\nNICK: Yeah so I'm on Discord I'm on Twitter a lot, Telegram. EIP’s maybe, I could possibly I'm still I just made some improvements to the diamond standard is actually not called the diamond standard it's actually just EIP 2535 diamonds got changed because there's there was some other project that's called the diamond standard they didn't like that it was called the diamond standard so I changed it.\n\nJACK: All of these names hey?\n\nNICK: Yeah I’ll just keep going, I'll just keep changing until people stop complaining about it.\n\nJACK: Awesome well Nick thank you so much for coming on it's been a pleasure talking with you.\n\nNICK: Okay thank you guys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},{"node":{"captivate_link":"https://player.captivate.fm/episode/e5f2cb2a-8341-4299-96ba-9fb557bbf62f","description":"Aaron Wright believes that you usually get the best answer to a problem when you speak to a lot of people.

It's a pleasure to have you. Would you be able to just give a quick background on who you are and where you came from? \n\nAARON: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks so much for having me. I am a professor at Cardozo Law School, a law school in New York, and also the co-founder of a blockchain based project called Open Law, which is building some really interesting blockchain technology related products and services focused on the intersection of the legal industry, smart contracts and digital assets. And we use that technology to pull together recently, a couple new forms of organizations referred to as decentralized autonomous organizations for dApps. So it's really great to be here. \n\nJACK: That's a pretty interesting line of work. How do you get started going down that path that sort of entrepreneurial tendencies start from a young age? \n\nAARON: Yeah, actually, it did. So I don't know why. But I've always kind of had the itch to start something on my own. You know, from a young age, I was always looking for different ways to, to make a couple extra bucks or, you know, kind of buy the things that I was hoping to get, I didn't really grow up with much real working class background in New Jersey. And, you know, my parents gave me a very meager allowance. So if I wanted anything, I kind of had to earn it myself. So what does that mean? When I was in grade school or grammar school, I was packaging up baseball cards and selling that to my friends at school for $5 a piece so that I could buy things like a remote controlled car. And I started working, when I was legally able to in the US at the age of 15. Working at supermarkets and pharmacies and delivering pizzas and doing a whole bunch there. I rake leaves shoveled snow, really anything I could do to kind of make something happen. I tried to do that. So I always was at school working at least one job sometimes too. And that continued all the way through college, when not only was I going to college, but I was also working one or two jobs. And, and that was right around the time that you know, the first wave the internet was beginning to boom. And one job that actually paid the most on campus was web development. So because of the high hourly rate that was advertised, I was able to convince somebody, and at one of the departments that offered, offered this opportunity to give me a break. And let me learn how to program and do web development on the job. And really, that kind of accelerated my path into technology, I started doing a whole bunch of things in the tech ecosystem. First, I just started building websites for different departments at the university that I was studying at with a good friend of mine that I grew up with. And then I went to law school, because there wasn't much work to be had. And that was right around the time, web two was starting and beginning to blossom. And even during law school, I was putting together various different websites and projects and really beginning to tinker around with things like Wikipedia and user generated content. And when I graduated law school, lots of people in the US they congratulate themselves and take a trip to Australia or somewhere far away. That's difficult to get to. I decided to build a website in my apartment with a couple other friends and an app but to kind of my first venture as an entrepreneur. That's a little bit about my kind of story to entrepreneurship. So I feel like I've always kind of had it in my in my bones in my blood for some reason. \n\nDAVID: Sure. And maybe go there. So what was your first venture and maybe describe it in in brief? \n\nAARON: Yeah, so my first venture was a initiative called armchair GM and it was a user generated sports site. So I became enamored after college with Wikipedia, I saw this entire movement of dynamically generated content I just thought was fascinating. So I stumbled upon It while I was studying for classes, I was looking for some more information running a Google search and Wikipedia came up. And I never really had been to the site before. And I thought it was interesting that it had an answer. And I kept on doing that, during the course of my studies, and Wikipedia kept on coming up again and again. And so I began to dig in and really got fascinated with the, with the community and ecosystem. Around the same time I was studying and had studied in college behavioral economics, and, and became kind of fascinated with this notion of groups coming together, kind of neutralizing their biases, and building something that was arguably superior to what an individual could do alone, and just fell down that rabbit hole. And that rabbit hole, I thought, and that technology, I thought would not just apply to encyclopedias, but apply to a whole range of knowledge. And looking around kind of the internet landscape at that, at that point in time, it seemed it seemed like sports was ready to, to kind of undergo a bit of a Renaissance, there was sites in the US like ESPN, which is a popular cable, you know, cable, news entertainment channel, that there wasn't really kind of a user generated sports site. So we thought that that would be kind of a good project to begin with. And it turned out that we are right. You know, people love to talk about sports, they know a ton about sports. And we set up and modified the core technology behind Wikipedia, which was open sourced. And people just went nuts. They just started editing and contributing stories, building a whole bunch of different things. And we just kind of raised to keep up with the community. And so grew really quick, we kind of caught lightning in a bottle, which was great. And even though I was working another job, and the folks I dealt with, were also working another job, but just kept on growing and growing and growing and nights, weekends, any free time that we could scrape out, we were dedicating to it, until we got an email from Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, who asked that we meet. And so even though we were pretty happy with how things were going, and we were beginning to contemplate looking for outside capital. And we began to talk with Jimmy wells, the founder of Wikipedia about potentially adopting some of the technology that we had built and modified and extended from Wikipedia, into his new venture, which was called Wikia, which is the for profit version of Wikipedia. And so after a whole bunch of conversations and conversations with other publishing companies in New York, we decided that it would be great to work with Jimmy and help build out the for profit version of Wikipedia called Wikia. And that's what we did. So we sold our venture, I'm sure GM, put a whopping $2,000 into it, and sold it for lack of a lot more. And then, and then that really kind of got me down the path of trying to build, you know, more robust internet technology.\n\nJACK:  That's unreal, like the growth from starting with $2,000. And ending up being able to partner up with the founder of Wikipedia is something that's kind of, like unbelievable for most people to think that that is a reality that can happen. Did you have that in the back of your mind when you were spending all your waking hours building, armchair GM? Or did it sort of just start coming all into place and falling into line for you? \n\nAARON: Yeah, you know, we didn't even think that that was a possibility. You know, we chose kind of this open source technology powering Wikipedia, because we didn't have that much time. So, you know, we just wanted to see this thing come to fruition and thought that this was a good way to do it. And, and thought that Wikipedia and its core engine would be a good place to start. So when we got the email from Jimmy, I remember circulating it to everybody. And we were just kind of blown away. And then, you know, things started pretty mellow. Like we met him in New York. And he was traveling a lot at the time, at a crappy diner down in Chinatown, New York just started talking about what we wanted to do and what we were planning to do. And so our initial vision was to not just have sports, but other kind of verticals related to user generated content. And that is, in many ways what the vision of Wikia was. So I think we're really aligned. And at least for me, personally, I also found open source technology, from law school and in other contexts fascinating and really loved that Wikipedia was deciding to open source the content related to it the underlying software, I just felt like that was the Right future and the right way to approach things. So we're also pretty philosophically aligned. So it's not something that we were aiming to do. But it was definitely a nice opportunity. And you know, and I think to our credit, we beat a lot of these other users generated blogging sites and content sites that that at least popped up in the US things like Bleacher Report. And, you know, a whole bunch of these other services, we always thought they were basically copying the stuff that we had done. So that that was always it's nice to be imitated. But it was also great to begin to build out kind of a more broad user generated content platform with Jimmy and a whole bunch of other folks from the Wikipedia and Wikia communities. \n\nDAVID: Right, and maybe talk more broadly about what that experience was like, what was Jimmy like, as a character?\n\nJACK: Yeah, you know, I, I learned a tremendous amount from Jimmy. And in particular, you know, how to manage and how to think about open source technology. And I also had the pleasure just, you know, being a lawyer, and also going to law school to meet lots of judges, and lots of other people that kind of sat in the middle of a lot of disputes. And I'd say, outside of some of the judges that I've had the pleasure of interacting with, or working for, Jimmy was probably the most judicious human being I've ever met. So if there was ever a dispute, his answer was always a way to find a path forward where both parties were right. And I think that that, that his nature, and his kind of instinct, really bled through and is one of the core reasons why Wikipedia was successful. So if people on Wikipedia were engaged in some sort of edit war, and there was plenty of them, where they couldn't come to agreement about something, I do think Jimmy was able to kind of bring them together, so that they could continue to push things forward. And I think managing open source technology is a difficult task, managing a community people is a difficult task. And I think that that that kind of instinct of his was, was really important. The second thing that he kind of drilled, at least into my head, or at least I picked up from him was this notion of not doing too much a priori thinking, they're not overthinking a technical problem. So he would always say, if we're thinking about new product, or new service, don't overthink it, just get it out there, see how people are using it, and then make modifications and changes. And from that, I think, you know, other entrepreneurs, like Mark Zuckerberg of the world, kind of have a more, I guess, aggressive way to phrase that, which is move fast. And, and, and, you know, ship things and and hopefully, they won't break right. So move fast and break things. I guess Jamie's version of that was don't do too much thinking off the bat, just ship, the ship, whatever you want to do. And let's see what happens. So that was really important. And then I think the last thing was just kind of the ethos about open source tech and open source technologies is very important. Now it was it was not as important back then. But I do think he was right directionally, just about the way the internet developed. And, and the need to have important pieces of the internet not owned by a company or corporation, but by, you know, different stakeholders from around the globe. So that was critically important. And then the last piece, I would say is the international aspect of Wikia was really interesting. It was fully remote before that was even a thing. So we were on IRC channels, and Skype. And there was no real coordinating office, actually, we, we rented and leased an office in downtown San Francisco, and nobody went to it, which was always kind of a joke internally. So, you know, people were very comfortable. Just talking asynchronously solving issues, you know, remotely hopping on calls, if necessary, without the need for kind of person to person interaction. And I think that that was just ahead of the curve. So yeah, so it was interesting, you know, funny story about onshore GM, we were also remote. So I knew everybody. But everybody on the team didn't know one another. And the first time everybody met was actually the day we sold the company. So we met signed all the documents necessary to kind of formalize certain things. And then and then we sold the company right after that, which was kind of bananas. \n\nJACK: So how about coordinating people in that sort of environment? Like how do you coordinate people that don't even know they're working with each other? Yeah, I mean, it's hard. I think, you know,\nWikia, in particular, tried to hire people that were deep in the Wikipedia ecosystem. So in many ways, those people naturally gravitated towards kind of a more asynchronous remote first environment. They were working on articles or dealing with tricky governance issues remotely from months if not years beforehand. And so extending that into Wikia wasn't usually a big issue. And there was also, you know, remote development teams, and that's where I think things are a little bit harder. You know, if you don't have somebody that is accustomed to not working face to face and not working in an office, sometimes there can be an adjustment period. Related to that. I also think you need people that are more expressive in writing. So if you have difficulty, you know, expressing yourself communicating or providing updates. And that's just not your natural manner. I think that remote environments tend to tend to be difficult. So, lots of challenges, but I really think it's hiring the right people that are kind of are self selecting into this, making sure that they're expressive, particularly in writing, and making sure that they, you know, they really care and are aligned when it comes to the vision, mission and passion in what you're trying to do. And I think if you can kind of find those folks, and sometimes they're rare, sometimes they may be a little bit odd in person, you can build something pretty magical. \n\nDAVID: Right and earlier, you said that you would kept your day job during this period, what was your day job during that period. \n\nAARON: So it was a lawyer. So I was working at a major, US based international law firm, and pounding away on various different legal matters during the day, and those were long days. And then it would be up till 234 am putting out fires, trying to scale things, trying to update the design or, or fixings doing a whole bunch of different tasks, and everybody was pretty much doing the same thing. We were all kind of doing it as a side hustle. \n\nDAVID: So you were doing 17 hour days for a few years\n\nAARON:  I pretty much been doing, you know, 12 to 17 hour days, for my entire life. So I'm just kind of accustomed to it at this point.\n\nJACK: Where do you get that motivation? That is, like, there's not many people that do that. \n\nAARON: I don't know, you know, I just I've always, always since I was young, like I noted before, I've always had to do my schoolwork, I always had a job on the side. So my days were always filled, did sports, they were pretty packed. So I really don't know anything different. And I think once you start, it's easy to keep on going. And, you know, I never really stopped. So maybe if I stopped and reflected on some of my internal madness, and then maybe that would cause an issue, but not yet.\n\nJACK:  Do you feel like you missed out on some important aspects of life...\n\nAARON: no, no, I think, you know, I think I'm fortunate in what I've been able to do that I've been able to work on great projects, great people with inspiring people. And, and I really, you know, in a certain way been able to, to help build this future. And when it's more equitable, one that's more participatory one that's more global in nature, and, and one that hopefully, is fair and kind of root out fraud and some of the other corruption and some of the other issues that we see across the globe, that hurts people. So being able to do that, as a law professor and thinking about important policy decisions. We're building technology that may be able to provide competitive pressure on legacy businesses that have maybe grown too fat, to fat profit margins, I think that's a really healthy thing to be a part of helping to build knowledge bases, Wikipedia, and Wikia is critically important. You know, I do really believe that information is kind of the key to, you know, to progress and also to the future of humanity, of humanity. So I've been fortunate to work with great folks and, and work on really interesting things. And I do have a fair amount of flexibility in what I can do and the latitude of what I do on a day to day basis.\n\nDAVID: Absolutely. And I guess maybe take us to the next period. So you sold the company. What happens next for you, and how does that lead to where you are today? \n\nAARON: Yeah, so once I sold the company, I spent a lot of time helping to scale Wikia. So when we joined Wikia, it was actually called the WIKIS that was animated by, you know, web one company called geo cities. And it was a whole constellation of Wikis. So the elevator pitch was if Wikipedia was the encyclopedia, Wikia was hoping to be the rest of library. And we went through, you know, startups journeys, so I was, I think, the third employee after the acquisition of Wikia. And it was super small, really small team that didn't have that much traffic. And we went through the process of scaling that too, according to Quantcast, and some other sites that keep track of metrics, the 17th largest site in the planet. And we did that in lots of different ways. We ran a whole bunch of experiments to see different verticals, that would work, we acquired a whole bunch of different smaller wiki base projects. So we rolled up entire industries, we worked on scaling solutions that ultimately led to the spin out of technology that's at the core of a company called fastly, which just went public a couple years ago, we cut partnerships with a whole bunch of different folks so that you know, more and more people could begin to think about how to, you know, use and enjoy user generated content. So that was a complete wild ride. And the company grew from a handful of people to over 40 people and, and I helped do that. And we also because Jimmy was talking to a reporter And decided that it would be a good idea to talk about search and how search should be open sourced and the algorithm should be open source, he was ahead of the curve there. This is before DuckDuckGo, or other kind of more open source search engines hit the market. We spent some time also building something called Wikia search, which was one of the first open source search engines and began to try to compete against Google to try to take a little bit of the wind out of their sails. Because I do think as a, my personal perspective, , yes, search should be open source. And it was a big task, I could tell you that I have a tremendous amount of respect for all the engineers at Google, we would come up with a new innovative way to do something, and a couple of days or weeks later, it would be incorporated into Google. So we definitely hit their radar. And they definitely were saying, if you want to come at us, we are ready to play. So that was a that was pretty fun, too. You know, and watching a young company grow is has its challenges, personnel challenges, you know, time challenges, but it was also really exciting. And a really great experience. And I learned a lot about, you know, how Silicon Valley worked. Because we went through a couple rounds of financing. I learned a lot of doubt, scaling teams, and I learned a lot about, you know, how to manage technologists and also learned a lot about, you know, building a company at scale, which is difficult. So that's a really wonderful lessons there. And that kind of led me into other open source tech and most notably blockchain technology.\n\nDAVID: Right And maybe, what are the key lessons maybe that you did learn from Silicon Valley and did learn from maybe during the Sandhill road, you know, trip?\n\nAARON: Yeah. So, you know, I learned that it's hard to raise venture capital. So you know, this was around 2000. And, you know, 2008, to 2009. So that the venture capital industry in the US has grown dramatically over the past, you know, 10 plus years, both in terms of the capital that's there, the types of investors, the structuring of the deals that become much more standardized at that point in time, a lot of the information that you can find today about raising capital, building a company, it just wasn't, it wasn't out there. It wasn't in the ether of the internet. So kind of learning the playbook from  the CEO of Wikia, a man by the name of Gilpin Gina, who happens to also be a phenomenal angel investor, and is back some of the best companies on the planet was great, you know, it really got me to think about technology and its potential in a whole new way. And there was a lot to learn about that. I also learned a lot about scaling. I do think one of the advantages that us tech companies still have is that they know the playbook on how to scale a company from, you know, a fairly large business to no global, international, massive, you know, quasi monopoly. And just seeing the difficulty and building a company at scale and deploying that out to millions of users. There's just a lot of lessons there. Both in terms of technical lessons, and the difficulty managing data and keeping sites up and, and also lessons about user feedback and making sure that users are happy and making sure that you kind of manage some changes to the site, to all the complexity, just dealing with the press and other folks related to that as well. So it was a really informative time. \n\nJACK: And are you still in contact with Jimmy? It seems like he was definitely a large figure in, in God in your sort of vision as well. Do you still have regular chats with him? \n\nAARON: Yeah, I mean, you know, we, yeah, you know, periodically, he's, he's kind of stepped away a bit from Wikipedia. He's really candidate over to the community. And it's focused on some other things. But yeah, we catch up periodically. He's a really nice guy. I mean, it was nice. We got to work in the same office with them for six months, we kind of were holed up building and building this open source search engine. And that was a really exciting time. \n\nDAVID: Right. And I guess, an important question would be how you applied some of the legal thinking to that the context that you found yourself in? And I guess an important question is how that led to where you are now and what your involvement was with ethereum project.\n\nAARON: Yeah, so in part, I stumbled upon Bitcoin because I'm super fascinated with open source technology, just like I was describing, from my time at Wikipedia, and even before or around Wikipedia, and an application. And, you know, if there was any, any new, interesting open source tech, I'd always you know, kick the tires on it, check it out, see what was going on there. And was, you know, an avid reader of various different tech sites and I just fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole pretty early.\n2011 I just started digging in and really thinking about it. And it kind of hit me in not just the, from the perspective of being really cool open source technology. But it also had other aspects that I was interested in most notably, economics, which is what I majored in one of my majors in college. So I kind of liked that this was an open source system that also had an economic component to it. And I just found it fascinating. And so after I left Wikia, and after the CEO of Wikia who I worked under left Wikia, he was thinking about a new payment system, a new kind of payment startup. This was before a lot of FinTech payments, startups emerged. And I was super into bitcoin. And I remember sending him an email saying, why don't we build something on Bitcoin? And he wrote back, I don't believe in tulips, which I periodically will send back to them just to make them make them laugh. So you know, I think I kind of saw, I think earlier than some other folks did, what was the aspirational goals of Bitcoin, which was to really build a global payments or a financial system that didn't have some sort of Central controller, or central operator. And I just thought that was fascinating. And because I was fascinated by it, I started going to Bitcoin meetups in, in New York, you know, starting in 2012, and 2013, and 2014. And they were really interesting places. So they'd be like, held in Chinatown in some random shop, like in the back, and, you know, and random offices. But it was a really fascinating community. And really, for the first time, since I saw the birth of the internet, that I feel that energy again, like people were into it, because of the technology, they kind of had that glassy eyed idealism that pervaded around the internet. And I just thought it was great. And I met some really interesting people, really smart people, and just kept on spending more and more time immersing myself in that ecosystem. And around that time, I began also thinking about protocols not just for money, but also for law and thinking about how Bitcoin could be more generalized. And viewing it not just as a payment system, but really as a protocol as an entire system. And because of that thought process, I remember messaging, when my friends from my Wikia days saying, I really think that there should be a protocol for law, there should be like a legal protocol, something like Bitcoin for law. And he wrote back to me, that sounds really hard. And I said, it does sound hard, but I feel like that's what should be built. And about a month later. And, and this was about a month later, metallic announced Ethereum. And so I was thinking a lot about, you know, protocols for law. And metallic was announcing projects that were talking about smart contracts, right. And generalizing that, and it was pretty darn close to some of the thoughts that I that I was thinking about at that point in time. So I think there was something in the ether, pun completely intended. And I just thought it was really, really interesting project and began to dig in deeper and deeper. You know, at that point in time, you know, Bitcoin was the kind of the, the big kid in the schoolyard. And everybody thought that it was only going to be Bitcoin there was only going to be kind of one blockchain. And it was hard to know whether or not a theorem was going to be a legitimate project. There was a lot of kind of projects that were interesting, but you didn't know if they could be done technically. There was a lot of projects that you weren't sure if they were legitimate, or they were just trying to make a quick buck. So I had questions about it there and off the bat. And I, you know, went to the website, the team behind it, and noticed that Joe Lubin was helping it out. And I saw that Joe Lubin was speaking at a tech event in New York, and I never paid for any tickets to go to any events, but I paid for ticket to go to event he was speaking at. And this whole purpose was just to say hi to Joe, and see if I could help out. At that point, I was just about to start as a professor at Cardozo law school. So I went to this event, Joe gave his talk with somebody from you know, Dogecoin, it was somebody from digital currency group that was speaking, and a handful of other folks. And after the talk, I went up to Joe and said, I think the room is amazing. Let me know how I can help out in any way. We exchange information and, and then we just started talking and so he invited me to the office where kind of the New York part of the ethereum ecosystem was working out of and started meeting, you know, folks that were helping to build it and just continuing to fall down ethereum rabbit hole\n\nDAVID: Right, and what is continuing to fall down the rabbit hole look like for you what happened next?\n\nAARON: Yeah, so you know that where ethereum was being built in part in New York was not glamorous, it was in Times Square. And New York, it was in a co working space, and not something that looked like a we work, it was a dimly lit, orange, yellow hued co working space that looks like it was built before people even knew the term co working space. And Joe had a little office in there, and, you know, folks would float in, and I just started working at it there. And, and, you know, Metallica would come into town and Charles Hopkins, who's done a lot with cardano, sometimes would be there, keep them on would float by, and there's a lot in our own right. And, you know, various different people that were part of the ethereum ecosystem would just be there either building, talking, discussing, and it was super interesting. And, you know, from that, I offered to help out with some of the legal structuring, just thinking through, you know, how to do it there in in a in a responsible way, and in a way that, you know, hopefully would give it a shot, and to grow and succeed without running into regulatory challenges. So I put a lot of time and effort into that. And I also had the pleasure of thinking through how to support a ethereum with in not just legal ways, but also supporting it by helping to build out some research components of it. So me, vitalik and Kieran Lubin, Jonathan sun put together an organization called the cryptocurrency research group. And we began to think about and plan different events related to solving some of the vexing technical, economic and legal issues related to blockchain technology, things that I think folks that have looked at blockchain technology have thought about quite a bit in some capacity. So we put together and Kieran really took the lead here the first major conference on crypto economics called crypto economic con, which was held in Silicon Valley. You know, folks from ethereum ripple, what's now definitely, and lots of different projects, lots of different people that have built really nice careers in the blockchain ecosystem. Were all there and began writing a bit, started writing a paper with a co author who was a fellow at the Berkman Center at Harvard University on hard problems and crypto law. And started thinking about lots of the tricky issues that the technology would develop, and really started thinking deeply about smart contracts and, and how they can, how can how they can apply and impact the world. And so this paper, hard problems and crypto law, turned into a book. So we intended it to be a paper. Some editors at Harvard thought it was really interesting. So that turned into a book that Harvard University Press published. So that took quite a bit of time. And then from that research, I started doing a lot more when it comes to when it came to smart contracts as legal contracts. So that's, in part what I've been trying to, to work through with a project called Obamacare. And, and lots of other events happened along the way, you know, we hosted and you know, at Cardozo law school, the first security meetup and from that first ethereum meetup, the Genesis insurance of a company called consensus was born. A lot of the people that joined consensus and helped build consensus, we're at that meetup. And I got to work with a number of great teams, from my time around the current ecosystem. So that's when I met Sergei and Steve from chainlink, and began to help them out of it and help them think through, you know, the types of products and services that they may offer, which and channeling for folks that may not know it is a, you know, significant and major blockchain based project. I think it's one of the top 10 at least measured by market cap, and began to help Joe and think about what consensus should look like and, and how it should be structured and what types of things that you focus on. So lots of really interesting conversations around that time. \n\nDAVID: Right. And it must be wild to see to have seen consensus grow from the start, but I do want to take a step back and sort of frame the problem that you were initially trying to solve around, you know, structuring, do you put it in a responsible way of the ethereum project? How would you characterize the problem that you face and what were you solving for? \n\nAARON: Yeah, so the problem was, you know, the folks that wanted to build the theorem didn't really have the capital to do so. Now, you know, as any entrepreneur knows, it's hard to build technology. You need people to be focused on it at the time and space to build something new. And one thing that Metallica was hoping to do was to exchange Bitcoin for a future promise of ether if ethereum network launched. And that's just a tricky issue, because you're exchanging one digital asset for another. So there's tricky issues when it came to simple questions today seemed almost commonplace. But can you exchange Bitcoin for another asset, people didn't have answers at that point in time to whether or not you could do that? Are you able to have people donate to Bitcoin so that you can begin to build a project? Right? If you're going to do that, and you want to build an open source platform, where should it be located? Should it be located in the US should be located in Europe should be located in Asia? questions related to that?\nAnd it has questions about how the network should be rolled out. You know, should that be sorted by one party by multiple parties? What's the right way to do it? Not just from a legal regulatory perspective, but also from the success of the project perspective, if you truly believe that you're trying to build a global permission list, and generalized blockchain that can support lots of different assets, what does that look like? Right, should be owned by one person should be owned by foundation? So lots of challenging questions are, are kind of embedded in, in, in very broad platform like technologies, like, you know, like, Eethereum. And so we began to sort those out. And there was lots of people who, who felt that what ethereum did may run into securities laws issues. And I, I personally think that it didn't, you know, it was really a saleable product. That product was ether, and gas for, for network. And, and it was a little bit different than a lot of the token sales that we saw, subsequently, after the launch of ethereum. \n\nJACK: And when you were solving these sort of problems, was it you and vitalik, in a room with a whiteboard? What did it look like? Was it in these underground basements behind closed doors?\n\nAARON: Yeah, it wasn't really underground base. And so just a series of conversations and talking to different folks and getting input. It was very open source, right. And, you know, doing things kind of in a cloaked way doesn't really work, usually get the best answer when you talk to a lot of people get feedback, and people push back on it, and then you just make your best decisions that could be made. So you know, that that's what it was like, it was in a very unglamorous place, right, this kind of dingy, co working space. And in midtown Manhattan. It's a glamorous location near Atlanta space. \n\nDAVID: Right. And did you get the sense that what you were building had extremely sort of broad implications for the way that society, I guess, could work?\n\nAARON: Yeah, I mean, I had the inkling. And in part, I decided to allocate too much time to it, because I thought the folks that were building it, not everyone, but a number of the folks that were building it were really special. And that, that I think I learned from my Wikipedia days, you know, there's certain people that I thought had a knack for building an open source project. And a lot of the folks that were at Wikia didn't just work there, but had previously either led or built some pretty significant open source technology. And I just saw in vitalik, and the way Joe was, was helping and participating. And with Gavin wood, who's obviously gone to, to build a couple significant open source projects. They just had that right next, and they had kind of the right approach to things. And I thought vitalik was a bonafide genius. And he would, he was young. At that point, I think he was 19. But he had, he was incredibly smart. He was incredibly hardworking. And, you know, he would write incredibly lucid things just by sitting down and, and pounding it out, actually never saw somebody like that. So I really thought he had a really special mind. And, you know, Joe, is, you know, equally brilliant, you know, Princeton educated, long history of building successful projects before he got to Ethereum. And I just thought he really had a knack for kind of stirring things. I thought, Gavin wood was a genius, as well, and really had the feeling that he had the technical chops to do it. But there was lots of questions as to whether or Ethereum could be built. A lot of the naysayers in the Bitcoin ecosystem didn't think it was technically feasible for it to happen. So people were holding their breath at it, but once you started to see it, operating, once you're able to play around with it on test net, you know, you could tell that something special was kind of happening there. But I think, you know, from my vantage point, even though you could tell something  special is happening, I think a ethereum is always kind of outpaced the really ambitious goals, etc. Both in terms of adoption and use cases and applications. And you can kind of always, you can kind of always think about how technology is going to develop, but when you're kind of in the middle of it, it sometimes can be a bit surprising. And I think Ethereum is always surprised me just in terms of its resiliency, and, and really its ability to kind of fulfill its vision. \n\nJACK: And I guess, given where we are today, are you surprised?\n\nAARON: At this point? I'm not right. I feel like the you know, division was clear. The technical implementation, I think was done. Well, right. And, you know, there's always questions about open source technology and its quality, and people can always snipe around the edges. But at this point, you'd have a system that's been in operation for over six years. And it's moving a tremendous amount of value securely. And a lot of the use cases that people were talking about in, you know, 20, late 2014 and 2015. And, you know, frankly, even earlier than that, and the Bitcoin ecosystem, they're coming into existence, right. So back then everybody was talking about DFI, they just were calling it smart derivatives, smart options. You know, people were thinking about stable coin implementations back then. And that's been implemented. They were talking about on block chains and block chains being used for provenance and kind of the whole NFT or non fungible token boom that we're seeing right now was talked about the first demos that I that I saw, and this was at an event at Harvard, when Cavalia was showing kind of an early prototype for Ethereum was gaff coin, right? So people are been toying around with personal tokens right now. But really, that was the first use case that I that I remember seeing on ethereum off the bat. So a lot of the pieces that people were talking about, the tech is finally caught up to that vision. And at least when it comes to the pure crypto side, so at this point, it's not it's not surprising. And but I would say it was surprising, as was, as it was growing because it grew really fast, right? When you see hyperbolic growth, it's still hard for your mind to kind of wrap around it. I'll give you one little story here, grab a drink with Joe, just to catch up, went to soccer bar in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Nice place, meeting up with another academic just to kind of talk about auction policy stuff. And it was like a Tuesday night, Monday night, you know, working nights, so wasn't that crowded couple people on the soccer bar. And having a nice time, waitress was really friendly, asked, you know, Joe, what he did mention it, that he's done a lot with ethereum mentioned that, you know, that it's been really fun. And the table next to us, to two women. They were just having a nice time, they overheard the conversation and turned, opened up their wallets, which had Coinbase apps on them and showed you how they both own ether. And I remember turning to Joe at that point in time and being like, what is happening? What is going on? So that was kind of one of those moments when, you know, because we were deep in it, but we were in the weeds. I think for me at least I was missing kind of the forest for the trees. And but but then at that point, I think we recognized that it was becoming a bit of a phenomenon\n\nDAVID: Right. And I guess, an initial problem that you, you mentioned that you were solving for was around this idea of there being a legal protocol that is sort of instantiated within the wider Western world, if you will. Where have you gotten to with that project? And maybe frame where you are now?\n\nAARON: Yeah, I mean, so, you know, Bitcoin didn't come out of thin air, there was a long conversation, in particular from a group of folks that call themselves cypherpunks, that have been thinking about the use of strong cryptography, and how it can be used to transform the world. And, and, you know, these were the folks that were experimenting with different digital cash systems, or E cash systems for years before Bitcoin was launched. And a lot of those folks were not just talking about digital cash, they were also talking quite a bit about digital contracts. And, and, you know, it's always hard to have a consensus in a morphus group. But there seem to be a number of folks that recognize that, to really rebuild the commercial system, you're gonna need three core pieces. One piece is digital cash system, something like Bitcoin, or some digital asset that kind of serves as a base currency. The second one would be an E write system, where smart contracts in a system where you can define rights and obligations around those assets. And the third one was a notion called a recording contract, or a contract in the traditional sense that we'll be able to manage risk, and not only manage risk, but be digestible, understandable, and interpretable by machines. And thus far, we've seen digital payment systems like Bitcoin, and stable coin systems that are on top of ethereum. To have a stable value. We've seen ethereum itself effectively be a smart contracting system, where you can structure the transfer of assets, you can structure rights and obligations related to assets. But there wasn't anybody that was making a substantive effort at building this last leg, which is a recording contracting system. So I became fascinated with it and just wanted to figure out what that could look like, you know, how could we turn these dusty, very boring things called contracts into digital systems, digital artifacts, that are able to read information, right information, and an end are interpretable by humans and machines. That's a pretty vexing problem. And so we began to think about what that could look like. And that manifested into open law. And open law, what it enables folks to do is to take any agreement and structure it so that underneath the hood, it's a data object, it's something a computer to understand. But when you look at it, it looks like a normal, everyday boring contract. And it also can interact closely with smart contracts. So the moment somebody signs the agreement, just like you would on DocuSign, or hellosign, e signature solution system, it has the whole power of a blockchain sitting behind it. So if you wanted to move an asset, if you wanted to transfer an asset, if you wanted to create a new organization, you can do that. Right, from a signature, or right when all the parties that were necessary to sign something had signed it. And, you know, we've we've come really close, and I think it's a great attempt at an If not, hopefully, a solution to a recording and contracting system. You know, contracts are important. contracts that have existed since Mesopotamia.\nThat's where archaeologists have found the first contracts. And think about that for a second. Humans got together to build societies. Some people credit that so that they could brew beer, right and, and do that and get drunk and like, and manage grain in a more efficient way. And the next thing that they spent time doing was drafting contracts. So as long as we've gotten together as societies, we've had these artifacts called contracts that have existed. And yet, they're not that dissimilar from what we had in Mesopotamia, right, they're still written down for the most part, they're still hard to parse hard to understand. And, and I think we can do better. And that in many ways, I think, is one of the sub stories of this commercial revolution that's happening around blockchains. Like how can we actually have better commercial relationships so that the world can be knitted together a little bit more closely? A little bit more securely? And hopefully, make sure that people can do things that they're hoping to do in a more efficient way. \n\nDAVID: Right, and I guess, how does that sort of frame your vision for how companies will form in future and what I guess the corporate world could look like?\n\nAARON: Yeah, I think it's, I think what we're, we haven't yet seen in widespread adoption is a new digital form. With an organization, so historically, with each tech revolution that we've had, there's also been innovations when it comes to legal structuring. So if you go back to, as an example, the birth of industrialization in the US, at least, that led to the creation of the modern Corporation. So a corporation that wasn't chartered by a state, like what we saw in Europe, but a corporation that can be chartered by any citizen. So that started here in the US, after the Revolutionary War, in 1811, in New York, so folks decided, hey, if you want to start a business, that's great, you can ask the state for permission, it's going to be freely granted. And that means you're not going to put your assets at stake. And so that that was one of the major reasons, this joint stock company, one of the major reasons that people were able to engage in industry, right, they could start a whole bunch of different companies, whether that was, you know, a company to know wheat, or to weave clothing, where it makes shoes, right, they could begin to the process of industrialization in the mid 1800s. With the birth of the railroads, people had to figure out a way to assemble capital, right. So you could build something really expensive, like a railroad system, those were not cheap things to build, you know, they're not cheap today, they weren't cheap back then. And that led to the birth of preferred stock. So different innovations when it came to, you know, how stock should be structured inside of a company. And that fueled a whole bunch of innovation, both by roads, and also what you're seeing today in Silicon Valley, the structuring underneath most venture capital investments, pretty much older there, you pay an homage to, to how Barrow deals were done in the 1880s, as globalization took root, in the late 1970s, and into the 80s, and 90s. And today, there was another innovation, the limited liability company, where, again, happened to happen in the US. But a state Wyoming said, Hey, if you want to structure, an organization, you can do it. And you can do it any way that you want. As long as you've got a contract in place that clearly defines what everybody's going to be doing. And that flexibility, enabled a whole host of different enterprises, from mining operations, which was the first use case for an LLC, to hedge funds and private equity funds and all these pools of capital that we see around the globe. But we're no longer in an industrial era.\nWe're in the internet era. And we haven't yet seen the widespread adoption of a digitally native organization, one that kind of reflects this substrate of the internet. And that is, in my mind, a decentralized autonomous organization, or an entirely digital organization, those organizations I think, are going to be a little bit different than corporations, they're going to rely on software, smart contracts, to kind of manage capital, and knit people together, why it's really efficient and easy to use this technology to collect capital and manage it. Secondly, they're probably not going to have formal boards or managers. It's actually better, I think we're increasingly seeing this quitting on things like with GameStop, to have a whole broad group of people that are supporting or backing a project, actually getting more stakeholders involved, creates a more stable environment. And guys, I think have that capability to enable folks that are really interested in a particular company or project or enterprise to be involved in its future growth. And last, it can scale globally, right. So when we think of organizations today, we think about them in terms of our country, so it's a US company, or Australian company, right, or Canadian company, or, you know, a company based in Singapore, or some other some other jurisdiction, I think increasingly, those differences, when it comes to national borders are just gonna matter, a heck of a lot less. And organizations that are relying on a ethereum relying on smart contracts, and have these characteristics I think just grabbed nicely onto this world that I think has been built.\nAnd so I find that that's going to be really fascinating part of the future of the next, you know, 510 15 years, these organizations will continue to grow, they'll continue to manage more capital. And I might, my gut tells me that they're going to be more efficient than existing enterprises. So like we saw, and are seeing with Bitcoin and ethereum and digital assets, it just kind of suck in value. My sense is Dallas will continue to suck in every form of organization. Until it it's one of the dominant if not the dominant form of organization around the book.  \n\nDAVID: Right and maybe speak to the relationship between your involvement, I guess, or interest with open source communities, and user driven development of platforms and how that's relevant to what you're currently doing.\n\nAARON: Yeah, that's a really great point, you know many ways. And the activity that's going on in the blockchain ecosystems is, is just the tip of, of activity that has gone on in open source communities for a while. Now, open source communities are very flat. Oftentimes,\nno leader, there's a group of leaders, people come in and out, people spend a couple months on a project, and then we'll fade away, new folks will emerge, and there's no structure or formal structure around them. And there's a, there's a really open borders to how people can participate in it. So if you wanted to contribute to an open source project, you can, you just have to download the code, find where people are talking about it and jump in. And I think that that's, in a sense, the way organizations will look in the future, there'll be less formal, less hierarchical, and a little bit more open and permission less. And I think what we're seeing in the blockchain ecosystem will eventually bleed back into open source technology. And since open source technology has such a huge footprint and an increasingly important footprint around the globe, it will become the standard. And as it becomes a standard, and as you're increasingly able to monetize open source, it, I think, will become the structure of choice for more and more technology projects. And if you believe this hypothesis, that software will eventually eat the world. And a software developers prefer open source technology, well, then, you can imagine how these types of organizations may be the primary vehicle. So if the software developers, likes open source technology, and if this is a great way to organize something that looks like an open source project, well, then decentralized organizations or these digital organizations may be the pathway to the future.\n\nDAVID: Right? And what else have you been involved with? \n\nAARON: Quite a bit, Quite a number. So you know, one, one data that I or something that you can consider a Dao is possibly Bitcoin, right? So Bitcoin is open permissionless, that it relies on software to coordinate activity, there's no person or single person that's in charge of it, people float in and out of it in different ways. You know, so, you know, I definitely participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem, I think you could say the same thing about ethereum. Nobody really runs ethereum retallack and some other folks may have created it, but you can't do that much. Now to change it, you can express his opinion, but if people disagree, it's not gonna really matter much. And I've also more recently spent some time sorting through, you know, what guys can look like the US given the current regulatory environment through a couple projects. One project is called LAO, and the second one is called slimming down. And LAO is really focused on how to support blockchain based projects, and ventures starway. So providing capital that young technologists or technology teams need in order to, to grow project, and Flamengo Dao is focused in on acquiring digital art, and other digital collectibles and other things that are scarce and natively recorded onto a blockchain. And both are really interesting projects. There's about $25 million in ether that have been contributed to both of these DAOs, and 30 plus projects and hundreds of pieces of digital art and other collectibles that have been acquired. So they've been super interesting, and really, really fulfilling to be able to help hold together and, and hopefully help grow.\n\nJACK: Just to just to bring it back on you for a second. How would you characterize the subjects that fascinate you? How would you box those into a single category?\n\nAARON: I mean, I think that the things I've always been interested in are technology. And maybe I'll take a step back. My dad was a scientific researcher in the United States. He was on the internet since the 1970s. So when before the there was the Internet, and early prototypes, the internet, my dad was on it. So he was one of the scientific researchers that had access to it for sharing information. He worked for the government. So my life has been dominated by computers. So even though I'm 40 Now, the first time I was on the internet was when I was five. So I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people that was natively digital. And so technology has always played an important role in my life. You know, I remember First Family Computer when I was five and playing video games. I vividly remember the first time I downloaded a JPEG over the internet, with my friend in his basement and cheering when we this image progressively load on the screen. I remember being in that same business and learning about amazing technology projects, like Google for the first time. And technology's always played really an outsized role in my life. And I've always been fascinated with making things better, you know, building a better world. And to me, technology's always the best pathway to that, you know, you can make the world better by coming up with more sensible rules, but you can oftentimes just make things better by making better things, and better systems. And so technology's always been important. I majored in college and history and economics. So I think there's a lot of lessons to learn from the past. I think, you know, while history doesn't repeat itself, certain patterns do. And I think that's always been important. So I've always looked for kind of broad patterns and thinking. And then economics is important, right, economics is fundamentally about aligning incentives. And I do think that outside of technology, economics is a really important thing to know. And then the last is law. I just think law is really interesting. You know, it's kind of the architecture for the world and thinking about how to structure society and make sure that people are nice and kind and fair to one another is really important. And so, I find that endlessly fascinating. So, you know, my interests are, are dry, right there, history, economics, technology. And last, but I'm definitely a nonfiction type person. And it's been a heck of a lot of time reading.\n\nJack: I guess I'm interested to know why. subjects that are apparently so dry, like they are quite dry, I'm not gonna lie. But how are they so rich for you? I still can't really understand that. Why do you seek so much interest or find so much value in learning these things, other than trying to push yourself to learn them? Because you know, that they're important to know.\n\nAARON: Yeah, it's never really been an important. You know, I just, I think for maybe it's the challenge, you know, I do think that there's something about trying to tackle a really, really large, difficult body of knowledge that I find interesting. So, you know, law is vast, you could spend your whole life reading legal texts and books and, you know, barely scratching the surface. And there's something very humbling about that. And I've always found that fascinating. History is the same way, right history can be told from so many different voices, and so many different perspectives. And people have different narratives of certain accounts. So pulling together a picture of what the past looks like, is difficult. And economics, I think, is the same way. Yeah, I think there's a lot a lot we still need to learn about, about how to structure incentives and do it the right way. And, you know, many ways, I feel like, in hindsight, we'll probably look at some of the leading economic thinkers today know that they were boneheaded, or, or misguided or didn't know enough about how things work. So I think there's a bunch of that. And then technology, technology is really the synthesis of selling different things. And you know, even looking at blockchains, the technology was old. Well, that tech existed since the 1970s, peer to peer networks, that's the internet, after all those early peer to peer file sharing systems.\nYou know, hashing has been around for a while, public, private key cryptography was around for a while, even the consensus algorithms that help people record information to a blockchain were around for a while. But it's kind of that process of assembling that all together. That's pretty, pretty fascinating. So, you know, it's not always being the most clever or coming up with the most bleeding edge thing. Sometimes it's just looking at a problem in a different way. And assembling it and applying technology that exists in one sector into another sector. So I always find that kind of fascinating. And I think that's the core of the human imagination. So I can endlessly read about it, you know, summit project, and really try to understand what people are trying to build and how they, how they envision a future that's hopefully better than what it is today. So I would say, you know, it's not really the target your question. It's probably the vastness of it. And then and the challenge that makes it interesting. \n\nJACK: And is it on a need to know basis when you do this research? Or is it more so?\nJust your research is guided by pure fascination? \n\nAARON: Yeah, it's usually like that. I tend to focus on just things that I find interesting. And then I just keep on scratching that itch until I feel satisfied. So it's just more curiosity. \n\nJACK: Yeah. And you've got the big itches. \n\nAARON: Yeah, I mean, I just, you know, I guess my issues last longer than others. So if if I find a topic interesting, I really want to dig in and understand it and make sure I have at least enough knowledge in it to be dangerous. So you know, necessarily need to be the expert, but sometimes that happens. But usually that's the case. \n\nJACK: You definitely seem dangerous.\n\nAARON: Yeah. In a good way. Yeah. pleasantly dangerous.\n\nJACK: Pleasantly Dangerous Exactly.\n\nDAVID: Where can people go and find you?\n\nAARON: Where can they find me I'm on Twitter, my handle is @awrigh01. And if they are interested in learning more about blockchains and their legal implications. They can check out the book that I co-authored. It's called blockchain and the law, the rule of code, which I think is a nice real for folks that want to think about some of the legal and policy challenges. If you're interested in tech, you can check out openlaw.io, which is the tech platform and all the documentation related to it. If you're interested in DAOs, you can check outLAO.io or Flamingo Dao, FlamingoDao.XYZ, and, and those are all on Twitter. So you can follow that as well.\n\nJACK: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for coming on. Aaron, it was great talking with you. \n\nAARON: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.\n\nJACK: Cheers.\n\nAARON: Cheers.\n \nJACK: And that marks the end of our episode at High Definition.

Thank you so much for coming here and speaking with us, we really appreciate the time that you've taken to do this. Would you be able to start off by just telling us a little bit about yourself?\n\nPRI:  Sure. And thanks so much for having me. It's so fun. Um, yeah, sure. So I you know, I work on a project and run operations for a project called Open law we've put together and really focused and honed in on DAOs, which are decentralized autonomous organizations, we put together one venture specific DAO called the LAO which is an ode to this 2016 DAO which basically pulled a bunch of Ethereum and the goal was really to deploy that capital to different projects. It failed kind of pretty gloriously. And you know, that DAO hangover is over. So we created the LAO and we also have another DAO called Flamingo which is specifically in the non-fungible token space, which basically is like digital art collectibles and the like. I you know, before that was a student of the law in law school, and then through that kind of fell through the crypto rabbit hole, spent some time at a agency in New York that did something like the bid licensing work worked at our three, which is kind of in the FinTech, crypto space. Or at least they created their own Blockchain called Corda. And then before that worked in politics, on Capitol Hill, so I worked at a think tank and then spent a couple of years on Capitol Hill working on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. So it's been quite a journey. And then I mean, I live in New York, too. So I guess that's a little bit about me as well,\n\nJACK: When you were working on Capitol Hill, either many people talking about crypto, is that where you got first exposed? Or was it in the news in 2017 or something?\n\nPRI:  No, no. Um, so you know, the where I came to Bitcoin and crypto, I guess, was kind of an interesting story. I mean, Tech clearly was where things were moving. And I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee side. So you know, there was a few folks working on a big cybersecurity bill. So it felt like the future of warfare, in many ways was all going to be cyber and tech related. And so I mean, that just kind of expose me a little bit about the world of technology in many ways. And I'm not a technologist by any means. I definitely came more on the policy, politics side of things. But actually, it was more like dinner time conversation in my home. So my father was a bit of a gold bug. And so he would read a lot of Jim Rickards dying of money, like really into this notion of, like scarcity and what money is and so we just chat a little bit about it, I was super skeptical. And this was back in like 2012 2013 of, of this idea of Bitcoin or internet money or magic money, like it was still pretty emerging at that point. And like, I recall, even like, you couldn't really purchase it anywhere. Like it was, it was it was difficult to come by. And so you know, it didn't fully click for me and we would just kind of chat about it there. And I was also working in politics at the time. So there was also like a, there was a scholar at one of the think tanks that I follow that would write a little bit about Bitcoin. So I was mildly exposed to it. It wasn't really until 2014 the summer of 2014, where I went to the British Museum one summer, and this is a summer before law school actually. I there was a small exhibit in there called like the past present and future of money and so it kind of just walked through what people would use initially it was like you know, peppers, beans, kind of walk you through, you know, paper gold gemstones, like everything and it would actually show you that show you what people are trading and then it went into credit cards and then after that, there were like pictures of Bitcoin and kind of more like expensive waiting what cryptocurrency was is like the future of money. And I think that's when all this came together, we're like seeing it next to, you know, peppers and credit cards, it made sense to me that you know it was going to evolve in this direction I went to so I kind of had that in my back pocket and I'm like, Okay, this is actually going to be something had that in my back pocket for law school actually saw the co-founder of open law and Aaron Wright quoted in an article about Bitcoin. He was a professor,  happen to be a professor at my law school met just reached out to him. We worked on a paper together my second year, and then I just worked for him my entire third year of law school, he would always kicked me out like the blockchain projects, because he ran a startup clinic. So he would just kind of kick that to me, I just started getting entrenched into that. And then 2017 was when I was graduating. And so it kind of had this, like, the timing was just unreal, like I was, you know, in law school during the DAO hack and everything that happened with the DAO and trying to figure out whether the DAO token was a security or not. So there was all this like, weirdness that was happening and a lack of regulation in the space. So yeah, the story is kind of a weird one. But yeah, a lot in there that that happen to lead me to where I am today. \n\nDAVE: Right. And I guess, like, it's a quite a long history that you have, I guess, maybe describe the family environment that sort of fostered the interest in the first place. \n\nPRI: Yeah, fair enough. Um, so actually, like, my brother is actually quite involved in this space as well. So I guess, I mean, you could say that my father was, most of our dinnertime conversation revolved around finance and politics, we weren't like, one to play games, or, or, you know, do the kind of typical family fun night thing. It was always like, really intense. Like, at one point, actually, like, just to kind of give you a sense of what my dad was like. So we would go on, like, my dad loved to travel. So really, really privileged in that way, where, you know, he took us everywhere, he was a super curious man. And so before any trip, we would go on, he would like make us put together like a PowerPoint presentation on like, sites and restaurants and things to do, and like, present it to the family. So it was like, kind of insane. But also, like, I think that just innate, like, having to dig and find things like it was almost like taught curiosity in many ways. And I think that that was definitely passed down to all of us kids, but, you know, you know, there was even to just kind of go beyond that, just to explain what kind of guy he is. And I actually even before going to Italy, we had like this Mitashi, like 18 hour DVD set, and he like, made us watch the entire set, it was super interesting about that family, but it was just to give you like a flavor of what he was like. So we would always like prep in these really, you know, intense ways. And I remember at one point, he like, literally would take out like whiteboards and would go through, like, what the Federal Reserve is, and how that relates to US government and how they're actually not, and how it's how the US Treasury is different than the Federal Reserve. And so, you know, that was kind of my childhood, and in many ways, and I think, you know, my dad read a lot, like, probably, you know, 12 to 13 hours a day, and he was an avid avid readers read, you know, everything we would get, you know, we my house was like, every newspaper, Foreign Affairs like CFR like everything from the right to left, like he read it all. So I think that's where he initially like, discovered the Satoshi white paper, and he himself wasn't actually a technologist at all, either. I think it was more actually, like more just, I think the whole ethos and the whole the 2008 crisis, which he was very, I mean, this guy might have is like, very much like a Zero Hedge reader. So he's always been like a little disillusioned by the financial system, and that kind of thing. So I think seeing the white paper, and everything really awakened him a bit, and he shared that with us. And now I'm glad he did. I feel like that was a monumental, you know, piece of my life. And so that's kind of what a little bit of my childhood looks like, here. \n\nDAVE: Right. And when did he first share that with you? Or when did you first discover the Bitcoin white paper? \n\nPRI: It's a good question. I want to say 2011. Yeah, \n\nDAVE: So it's pretty early. So yeah. \n\nPRI: Yeah, few years. Yeah, pretty early. I guess. It's funny because you talk to people and they're like, yeah, like I came in at. My least favorite thing is when people flex on when they discovered like, or when they came into this, it's like, they're really you are the better I guess, but it's Yeah, I mean, I remember even like, you know, there was some senate hearings and stuff. I think first talking about Bitcoin in 2012. And he would always watch those. I mean, he's been following. He was following it for quite some time. And yeah, so it was pretty early again, like, I was extremely skeptical. And I and I mean, you still hear this kind of rhetoric. But you know, this idea that it's like, used for nefarious purposes, which I'm sure it still is today. And it was back then. But so I at first thought it was kind of like, not great. And actually, even in law school, like I remember, my internet law class, or professor was like, Yeah, I mean, like, the internet really grew from pornography. Like, there isn't any major user like, God, why the internet design wise, even got better was the porn industry, because people like tried to have to, like finagle their way into like, using the internet to see that and like, that's a good point, like, in many ways, like some of these emergent technologies, like always start with nefarious purposes, whether it be like, or if you define that as nefarious, like porn or gambling or like just pure speculation, like it always kind of starts weirdly. So I guess in retrospect, it made sense. But yeah, I guess you could say he's pretty, pretty early. And I'm glad he shared it with us.\n\nJACK:  Yeah, your dad seems like he's not the average person. Now, what sort of components of, of his psyche do you think that you've, you've sort of adopted that have allowed you to become one of these pioneers in this space? \n\nPRI: You know, I kind of touched on this, but he's pretty obsessive. So I when it comes to not really seeking truth, I think he's someone who really would like try to dial in on that. And in many ways, so I think that like curiosity, when it comes to a particular subject of interests and obsession over something, I think, has been has, I guess, in many ways, entered my psyche I like, frankly, the internet also kind of facilitates that, like, if you're curious on any subject, it's pretty easy to do. So. I mean, yeah, I would say that's a big one. I mean, even with the as far as, like, the things he enjoyed, which was like eating enjoy life, like wine, just having a good time, you know, trying new things. He's, that's definitely something that I would say actually, my siblings, and I all have from him. And so yeah, hugely influential in my life. \nDAVE: Sure. And I guess, to come to more the present, this sort of lands to where you are today, I guess, what did it take sort of you to get involved with LAO? What is the level represent what is maybe give a brief explanation of what it's trying to achieve? \n\nPRI: Yeah, that's kind of an interesting story. So I, as I mentioned, work with Aaron Wright and law school. And he hired me for a project called Open law, which, which the goal of open law is to create like wrappers around smart contracts. So smart contracts, you know, as you guys know, are this is this technical means to transfer one digital asset to another, whether that be tangible digital assets, like, you know, a piece of property or that can be assets that are intangible like crypto or something else, some other token. And so in order to like, give those assets in a real world, meaning you need to have a legal document associated with that. So we were creating legal wrappers for smart contracts. And you could still do that today. It's an awesome protocol. And so we, we like internally as a team, you know, a lot of folks were using our public library. And I think there's a lot of interest in what we were doing there. And so we kind of there was this emergent of conversation of DAWs. That started happening early 2019. A lot of that, I think, had to do with the fact that the Moloch DAW, which is a type of smart contract framework had come out. And so we as a team had been increasingly thinking about a nice dap to use the open law tools in and so the open law team and myself included, And, others have always really been passionate about this idea of digital organizations. And if you think about it like this, the idea of an organization really is a bunch of legal documents and paperwork, tying individuals and binding them to one another. And so it kind of we just were contemplating a bit. And we thought, Well, why not use open laws tooling to create an LLC, limited liability company wrappers, around smart contracts, we put together something pretty hacky just for people to use, and that got a lot of positive feedback. So we started thinking about it, like why not use open laws tooling to create a full blown digital organization where people can pull together capital and democratically vote on where that capital goes. So we started, you know, and creating a full dap, like a digital application or decentralized application around that. So like the user experience is super friendly. So we basically did that. So we started building that in the fall and then let it launch at the end of April. And really like the objective there is, like I said before, people pull together capital and work together and decide where they want to vote on that capital. Where that Capital goes and, and you know, it's all wrapped in a Delaware Limited Liability Company, I guess in a holistic way. I mean, we are really kind of trying to push the boundaries on the future of coordination, human coordination on the internet, like right now, in many ways, like people are coordinating on the internet, but it's kind of in these like disparate silos, there's not a lot of it makes it difficult for them to, like, make decisions together. And there's really not like, a way to pull money together. Like I can't even really I mean, there, I guess there's like Kickstarter and such, but like, there's to actually, like, make decisions quickly, operationally, in a way that, you know, all the accounting is on the back end, and you can be from anywhere. So we kind of that that whole notion that really like, which I think personally is like a killer app of blockchain and Ethereum. Anyway, hasn't I mean, it's been done. And people in the DAO tried to do that in 2016. Unfortunately, you know, we know that there's that hack, and there was like, some legal structuring issues around it. But we really wanted to bring that vision to life. So you know, now that the timing is right, and people are more online than ever, it just makes a ton of sense to really start creating organizations digitally and having people coordinate on the internet. I think that's definitely where the things are going. So it's pretty exciting. \n\nDAVE: Right? And in that vein, I guess maybe speak to what that vision is of Ethereum doubt, as it was originally conceived. And I guess, how do you see companies forming within the next 10 years? \n\nPRI: Yeah, so the Ethereum DAO, I guess, for those who aren't familiar was this massive project that was quite amazing. In 2016, where similarly to the LAO members pulled together, I think it was close to at the time $160 million, were pulled together. And there was a massive, so and the idea similarly, is everyone would get a token, they would vote with that token, to declare, like, they'd want to fund x project, that project would get funded, and it kind of just, you know, float, I think, I think that from what my memory serves, that's kind of generally how they were thinking about the structure, then, unfortunately, it was like a massive, massive security vulnerability and the smart contracts. And a lot of that money got hacked, there was a huge, you know, debate on, I think, two debates, like whether the money should go back to people and they should, you know, hard fork it, or, you know, also whether or not they've even made sense from like, the legal philosophical perspective, like, this is what people signed up for, if code is law, then like, we shouldn't necessarily go back to it. And, and I mean, not to go too much in the weeds here. But there was also like, in addition to all of the kind of which I think this gets lost in the conversation is there was really little legal structuring around this around the original DAO in 2016. So, you know, if there is no legal structure around a certain organization like that, when you're pulling capital together, the default is that you're a general partnership. And that can, what that means is basically your liability could be on a personal level too. And that that, of course, could get a little dicey. Right. So you know, with the LAO, which we actually have the L in front of it's a limited liability company. So meaning that you're only like your liability is limited to your contribution amount. \n\nDAVE: Right. And I guess, to come to the point of where we're going, Yeah, it's clear where we're at 85% of the world's, you know, what value is locked up in private, limited companies? How do you think companies will form in the future? \n\nPRI: I mean, I think it's going to look a lot like what we're doing here, I think it's going to be, I do think like putting together the operating agreements will become a lot more seamless and quick wrapped, if you will, I think that you're going to have like, which I mean, in many ways, like a lot of that is, is fairly standard and boilerplate But then I also just think, you know, the ability to spin up a DAO for your community and like re skin, that is going to be a lot easier. So like the way I kind of see it, and this probably will evolve into something a little bit more cohesive, because right now it's like you have, we have like the DAP where you connect your wallet, and then you do the voting decisions. And then all the conversation happens on like a Discord. For example, I would imagine at some point, it gets a little more seamless, and everything's connected a little bit better. But for the most part, I mean, I think it's going to be like these guests, you know, there's going to be a group of members that coordinate with one another and just have conversations and, you know, obviously, there's some like stickiness with, with like, you know, that you're never going to get rid of some of these offline kind of touch points like the legal world in the real world. But I do think that every organization is going to be online at some point and it's just going to be easier to coordinate because we'll have like better applications to serve those communities I also what I also kind of think is cool about this technology is that unlike current organizations today, like you, you're not, you can actually like technologically like, bind some of these orgs. For example, with the LAO, like we joined another, we kind of like built a bridge to another DAO and contributed directly to that DAO. So kind of having these, like smart contracts that connect to other organizations is kind of interesting as well. So I think there's a lot of fun stuff that will emerge. And I think some of these organizations are going to be connected to one another's, you're going to almost have like this Hydra of like, a bunch of different organizations that have, like, a stake or connection to another organization, and it's going to look pretty, pretty interesting.\n\nJACK: And why do you think it's important we continue in this direction? \n\nPRI: Um, that's a good question, actually. I think I mean, I guess the answer that I guess most people would say, is it, it opens opportunities to people who normally wouldn't have them. I think there's a lot of operational efficiencies that are inefficiencies that get lost in corporations and organizations today, but mostly, I mean, to the to the first point I made, I mean, I think that this gives people the ability just to like, open a computer, get internet connection, and, and join an organization and join a community and make decisions on that community. I think that frees up a lot, I guess, I think that kind of breaks the barriers a bit for people to like, join certain things that they believe in. I mean, for example, now, and I guess maybe this may or may not be true, but I also like a lot of what decision a lot of decision making that happens today is concentrated to like corporations or organizations in major touchpoints around the world to like major cities, it's confined to a few major power brokers who generally get those opportunities before others, I think, you know, being able to just be curious, dig, find a community coordinate amongst a group of people that are like minded and interested in in the same things as you is pretty powerful and somewhat difficult to do in the real world I think so having the ability to do that is pretty great.\n\nJACK:  Is that why you got into the space? Or to see that sort of feature eventuate? Or is there a different reason? And that became that over time? \n\nPRI: Well, I always thought DAOs were cool. I mean, just, I mean, simply because, I mean, it is like the future organization, human coordination, being able to pull capital, but you know, I it's a, that's not what I thought I would be doing at this point, like I, you know, I thought, I don't know what I thought I would really, there was no like, clear objective, I think it was one of those things where you like, find things that interests you along the way. And like, with DAOs, it made clear sense after the DAO I recall even writing like a paper on securities law on the DAO because I've never seen anything like that, ever. And, you know, then from there, following what Aragon was doing a bit. So, I mean, I was looking at it from afar, and then we kind of were lucky enough to, to really, I would I was lucky enough to be on a team that was pushing in that direction. I think it makes a ton of sense. But yeah, it's interesting to ask the question of like, what I set out to do, I mean, like, frankly, I really believed in open law, the team. And I'm like, really just trying to see that through this idea of opening up. I think crypto in general, the reason I got in and blockchain technology was this, you know, democratic access to money organizations, you know, the monetary policy is such that it's kind of already decided for the group. And so I mean, I, I came in from that vantage point. And I feel like now I'm just kind of along for the ride, I crypto changes so quickly that I have no idea what's going to happen to DAO within the next like year or two. I mean, I think it could be like one of those things that we're just gonna see 1000s of them, they're all gonna be connected in some sort of web. So didn't necessarily set out to work in DAOs, but it's worked out.\n\nJACK:  I can't help but notice, you said at the side of the conversation that you were injured, that you were introduced to the white paper of Bitcoin around 2011. That also seems to coincide with when you started as a junior policy analyst at the House Committee of Foreign Affairs, and you were there for about two years over that course of your time there. Did the narrative of Bitcoin changed your life trajectory and get you to leave that position? That stable position? \n\nPRI: Yeah, um, you know, I mean, the truth is, I like wanted to get out of politics. It was like getting pretty, like I was I was sort of done with it. And so I will say like on the on the Foreign Affairs side of things. I mean, I keep it in my back pocket, this idea of crypto and what's going on, but it wasn't discussed as much publicly at the time, I would say like what was discussed was kind of closing before like cybersecurity and cyber warfare. There's definitely like a bill that was very that basically consumed much of the staff. And so that was always like, where things were going. And you could feel it. And, you know, hackers and all that. But I mean that that was I know, it sounds it wasn't that long ago, but like, no one was really talking about crypto at the time, it was something that I would talk about with my family, but and maybe a few friends. But even then, like I would say, most of my friends thought it was a little bit strange. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't really until much later, where it really kind of started to make a little more sense to me. But Sorry, I wanted to add another point on the Foreign Affairs side. Oh, yeah, the reason I left really was I just couldn't take it anymore. Like, it's funny. Now we like look at politics today. And like, Wow, I can't possibly imagine things getting so polarized, but at the time, it was it felt so I can't imagine being in DC right now. I think at the time, I thought it was too much for me. And, you know, getting anything done is really difficult. So on the committee side, the way it works is, like, you know, you kind of have to draft and go back and forth and negotiate with third party interests, you know, the minority staff what's going on with the Senate and the senate staff. So there's so many interested parties. And so like, by the time this bill that you're kind of excited about or like this provision that you're excited about gets added in becomes something that's completely different after so you kind of become a little bit disillusioned by that. And I guess, if anything kind of dislike and anti-establishment institutional rhetoric that I feel like a lot of people in crypto and blockchain had, if anything, like I would say, my experience there probably compounded that feeling. So I think like, there's a lot of things that are broken, and, you know, politics in some ways, being one of them. But yeah, that that was kind of my impetus for going to law school, I was I was ready for like to push on the next thing and, and really like dig in, I mean, but admittedly, like a tradition, like I thought I was going to be more of like a traditional lawyer, not necessarily like helping on the operation side of digital organization. So things definitely change. \n\nJACK: Yeah. Would you say that the DAO structure is almost competing with that bureaucratic structure that you see in DC?\n \nPRI: Um, well, I would hope that it's a little more streamlined. Maybe not? Not? I mean, I don't think so now, perhaps, maybe, I mean, I think they're probably some, at least not our DAOs. But I'm sure that they'll be some doubt communities where politics, you can't really get rid of human nature. So I think like, I'm sure things may become a little bit bureaucratic are difficult at times, or there might be some conflict. But I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, it. Hopefully with this, I mean, you have like these clean votes where an address is tied to and you can kind of move forward. But I mean, you never know, things could get like interesting in this space as well. I really, really hope it doesn't get like too bureaucratic, though, I think that would, that would kind of cut against the general ethos of what we're trying to do here. But I will say like, of the participants so far in this community, no one people have a pretty similar view on bureaucracy, I would say. So, hopefully, it doesn't creep in. \n\nDAVE: Yeah, I guess there's a clear line to draw between nation states and companies, they're quite different. But I guess if politics is broken, how would we fix it? And is what you're building offering to do so? \n\nPRI: It's a good question. I mean, politics is broken for a lot of reasons. You know, for me, personally, there's a lot of and I mean, the founding fathers even like warned on some of these items of like special interests getting in the way and you know, campaign finance and, and all these like third parties that actually in favors and all of that, that ends up kind of creeping in from what is supposed to be in the best interests of people. I mean, what we're building is fully transparent you know, you have this organization where proposals if they want to be can be public, you know, who's in the group, you can chat I mean, people can be anonymous or not, but I mean, that's not to say admittedly, that it could it could get dicey it really just depends on the people you have a little more flexibility with what you can do with the technology so if there is a bad actor or someone's you know, operating in a way that necessarily isn't aligned with the majority of people like you can there are features such as like rage kicking someone if it doesn't work out or, or if someone feels like it's not a good fit for them. Or if the whole you know, organization feels like it's heading in a direction that you don't believe in you can rage quit the organization move on. So I think what's different here is like you have this fluidity to move about that may or may not exist today. You don't necessarily feel locked into something, you if an organization or like a DAO dies or runs out of capital. If you don't like it anymore, you can leave. And we're that a subculture sub community that DAO can create another DAO and I think that you're going to see a little bit more like life and death. And they might have a shorter life cycle than what we see today, which actually just might be healthier. Hopefully we can avoid like these, like too big to fail scenarios or, like just one doubt, kind of consuming and other than just getting too large and that kind of thing. I mean, I'm hoping that we have like more of a fluid structure. And it's kind of what we're seeing today. \n\nJACK: I think I'm keen to take a step, sorry, take a step back. And think how this would impact the everyday person. So someone that doesn't know about crypto, just walking down the street? How does what we're talking about today impact to them? \n\nPRI: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. So I mean, there, it's one that is kind of interesting, because I like talk to my friends a lot about it, who aren't familiar with their space. So they're like, Okay, so what exactly do you do? What is it? What we know? Why is it? Why should I be interested in or how does it work? And so, I mean, I think the way that it impacts them is kind of related to the previous point about it being super fluid and this ability to meet people and join a community that has similar belief system as you and benefiting from that belief system, and, you know, coordinating with other people that you agree with and making decisions based on that. I mean, I think that it's kind of difficult to do that, like, for example. And this is kind of how I tried to explain it in many ways. It's, you know, you have these groups on traditional social media like or other like, you know, information hubs, I guess, like so you could have like a subset community or Reddit community, or a discord community related to like, a group of like-minded people, everyone has interests, everyone has, you know, something, imagine, you know, then adding some sort of internal currency or community currency, having some sort of way to literally take that community and make productive decisions based on that. So it's not just like, you know, some Facebook group that Facebook owns, you can now actually have some autonomy in this group and coordinate with one another to make decisions that may benefit you all, or give that community member a way to earn a token or something of that nature. I mean, the possibilities really, they're kind of endless, but I guess the way I think it affects regular, you know, anyone who may not be familiar with crypto is if you are part of a specific group online, which I think is many people today, whether even be on Twitter, your you know, you check, you know, a certain type of following that you're curious about, if you are able to engage with those people meet them, and then coordinate with them through some sort of token that kind of threads all of you together, I think that's pretty powerful. And you could start doing some really interesting things with that and make interesting decisions. And I mean, like, in the law, for example, we chose to pull Ethan and invest in various projects in the ecosystem, but you know, I, I'm a part of some other communities that are interested in, in like, varied subjects, and they're thinking of really, you know, cool ways to take the Treasury and, and allocate capital to people that manage the Treasury or people who manage the community. So you can start having these roles within the community. And again, like, you know, throwing a party for the, the discord group, if you will, or it could be something that's way more interesting, like, I don't know, creating like a nonprofit for something. So there's a lot of opportunities that people can come together and do that are so like, that are way beyond what exists right now in the community. And also, you know, that can relate to what exists on Reddit and others. So, yeah, I think it seems like very portable to, to what we have on the internet today. \n\nJACK: Do you spend like all your waking hours looking at this? I mean, it's pretty deep topic. And the way the space moves, is so rapid that it's almost like if you take a second away from the screen, you're missing out on something big. Do you have time for any of your other hobbies? Or have you sacrificed all of those to dive into this?\n\nPRI: No, I have not sacrificed all this but I will say like this, the space moves insanely fast like within I would say the last year we had a bear market we had defy which is decentralized finance summer, we have this boom for non-fungible tokens. So like digital art, collectibles and everything and now we have like this emergence of social tokens social community token so like the speed of which things are moving and the communities you need to participate in and the people you need to talk to and crypto Twitter and everything it's, you know, exhausting and but at the same time, like it's kind of addictive, like there's so much new innovation, so many interesting, smart people that are constantly just doing more and more interesting. So I mean, yeah, I would say that I am on a computer a lot part of that has to do with COVID, I would say more than normal. But no, I mean outside of all of this and you know, constantly keeping up with the cool projects and talking to cool projects and making friends within the community which honestly has been one of the most awesome things about being a part of the DAO like it's I think it's been really amazing to see the DAO members like the LAO members as well. And even the Flamingo which is the NFTO community members like actually kind of get to know each other and become friends, it seems like our help each other on different projects. I think that's kind of an understated benefit of some of these DAOs, like you meet all these people that are interested in the stuff that you are, and you can kind of just grow into getting to know them in many ways. But it was kind of a tangent, but I would say outside of, you know, really plugging into the crypto blockchain stuff online, I try to spend a ton of time on art, I've been like, kind of slowly building my collection this year, have saved a little bit of money from the fact that I just am not going out to eat or doing anything. And I gave up my lease in New York. So I've been trying to support some of the arts and buying things that I really like. And so I mean, that's definitely a passion of mine. And when I was, you know, in New York, I was able to go to a couple shows and museums and stuff, which so it's nice to get a little bit of culture and also just, you know, I would say outside of what I'm doing today, that's definitely what I've been focusing on, as well as like, I think in this weird COVID time just trying to call up friends and family. Um, I think that's honestly been kind of a concerted effort, you know, making sure that people are engaged in and well.\n\nDAVE: Right, and maybe speak to the ad hoc a little bit more, and how crypto sort of more facilitated? \n\nPRI: Yeah, yeah. So it's, it's interesting, I've been, you know, interested in art for a while, part of what I kind of liked about crypto also is this idea of putting digital prop property online, that digital property can be anything from real estate to, you know, an artwork, or really any kind of tangible item can be digitized through some sort of token framework. And so, we on the LAO side had been thinking about this idea of non-fungible tokens and, and this emergence of digital art, meaning artwork that sits on chain through a token and its reference. And so like, it kind of has all of these trademarks of traditional art where you can have like scarcity. And you can have actually better provenance because you know exactly what hands are holding a piece of artwork. And so there's been like a lot of talk and excitement around digital art. Actually, I would say like, even early in the days of open law, like I would say, like 2018, a lot of galleries, a lot of auction houses, others were thinking about art provenance and Blockchain like kind of, similarly, we saw a lot of those supply chain use cases. And so we're kind of you know, where the provenance is being you would take like a physical artwork, and then put that into tokens, so you can better track the provenance of that work. And now we're seeing just artwork generated online, with the token, and then you know, people have a collection that they have online and can display it. And so it's this, in a way, an entirely emergent art form, where you have this token that represents an artwork, people have an address tied to their collection. So you can go on someone's, you know, account on a website, look at their address, and see what's in their wallet, which is kind of fun, and just see, like, observe what tastes people have, and you know, what kind of art certain folks are looking at. So there's all these great platforms where people can kind of, and I often do this, like, look and see what other people are buying and selling. And so that's just been completely in boom, like, I mean, some of the numbers are insane. There was this digital artists, BEEPLE that had like a $3.5 million weekend selling his work. So the space has just been explosive. It's interesting now I think because I mostly have been interested in like a the traditional art sense, like I mean, I have been watching NFT's and was interested in crypto kitties after I saw an auction in 2017, where crypto kitty went for $140,000 I thought that was like, completely insane. But you know, I've been watching from afar and seeing all this great, great digital artwork that was emerging. And what we're seeing now is actually a lot of like, well known musicians, a lot of digital artists and like the contemporary art world are starting to take notice, because folks like BEEPLE are making $3.5 million in a weekend and so it's kind of seeing both worlds like collide a bit. So I've like followed a few digital artists in the past and now like this kind of gives them a medium to actually like buy trade, sell their work. So it's kind of you know, digital art has always been like a weird spot in the in the contemporary art market. And I think this like, fits really nicely. So it's nice seeing like, these kind of more traditional artists explore a new medium.\n\nJACK: And outside of just buying NFT's. How are you also helping that industry grow? \n\nPRI: Yeah. So you know, what the members of allow there's definitely like a cabal of members that are super into digital art and NFT's. And so, you know, at some point, like, there was, I think, a member that was like, Well, why doesn't allow by some digital artwork, we can, you know, just kind of buy some cool pieces, and it can be part of our portfolio. And the conversation just kind of went from there. And then we started discussing it and like, Well, why don't we have art collective of members similar to the LAO, but they're more like on the art, you know, digital property gaming enthusiasts world and create a collective around that. And we could, you know, have smart contracts operate in the background, it could be a limited liability company. So we, from that kind of idea that allow member incubated we created Flamingo, which is an NFT art collective where members basically are well, it's actually beyond just art. I think it goes to gaming and other collectibles, but it's an NFT collective, where members can come together and purchase, you know, anything from digital art to gaming assets, to digital land in different metal verses where you know, the idea eventually is to create a digital museum that displays all the digital artwork and collectibles. And then, you know, other kind of metaverse base, non-fungible token. So I mean, that's kind of it's I mean, it's an interesting group of people. He ranges from, like digital artists, to people who've been early in the scene to even like the venture capital types who are really like, excited by this space, you know, traditional art collectors. So I think there's a nice mix of people in there. And so I mean, outside of my personal collecting, and kind of watching the space and seeing different artists I see on like Superar, and other artists. And also, frankly, I've been like, I've always kind of followed a bunch of artists on Instagram and like seeing a bunch of them talk about NFTs organically has been pretty interesting as well. So I mean, flamingos doing a lot in that vantage point, I think it'd be kind of interesting to see them help Shepherd some traditional artists into this space too which I hope will be the case. \n\nJACK: It's, it's cool that you said a lot of the people that you're following on Instagram are becoming interested in this space. But one thing that I commonly notice is an everyday person looking at NFT's, which is digital art, in a sense, and saying, look, I can just take a screenshot, and I have it too. So what would you say to someone who argues that point? \n\nPRI: Yeah, if you hear that one a lot, like I sure I get it. I mean, I think it's, there's a complete, actually, frankly, if I had a work and everyone was screenshotting, and sharing it, I'd probably welcome it because it would just increase the value of my own work. I mean, at the same time ownership, you know, the scarcity. In addition, a number also matters, whether or not that's digital work or physical one, I don't think actually makes a ton of difference. And I've actually heard this, you know, quite a bit, but this idea of like, a Mona Lisa, like owning a Mona Lisa, and taking a picture or having a print of a Mona Lisa, or, or whatever is not the same thing. So I mean, one can Yes, like, take a screenshot and share it. And that's probably welcomed by an owner but owning it and then having that like sense of ownership over an NF t are not the same things, I think so I think it's kind of one of those just fundamental human nature of having some sense of ownership over like a rare item, or I think kind of translates actually in the digital realm. But yeah, that that screenshot arguments kind of interesting, I think, like, I think people it's like, sorry, I do think that we're gonna kind of like see this kind of emergence of people having their wallet address with their artwork. And I think you see it on Superar another and even open see where people like really like the idea of sharing that link. And like letting others see their collection, I think like that feeling is not going to go away. It's not dissimilar to like, going to some someone's like home and seeing their artwork. I know it might sound a little like odd now, but I do think that whether or not you own add it, whether or not it's in your wallet, and people can see it is actually going to kind of increasingly matter in this space. Sorry.\n\nDAVE: Right. That's okay. I guess in that vein, how do you think the future looks different than today for digital content credits in that sense? \n\nPRI:  Yeah. I think that kind of speaks to this new community and social tokens that we're seeing so you know, if you are a content creator and they're kind of glimmers of this already, like you're kind of seeing in the traditional media world, like these content creators that gain popularity through, you know, just readership through like a publication or just through Twitter or something like, you know, an individual platform that could be anything from tick-tock to YouTube or whatever. Like we were seeing on the web tour where people are building influence and clout, um, based on themselves rather than like a record label or, or a, or a publication. And so, um, I kind of think the next phase of that for these content creators is going to be tokenizing themselves. So being able to tether themselves to their audience and fans directly, I think will give the content creator a ton of flexibility and power that you don't necessarily see today. It's like, we're kind of seeing a little bit of that with like sub stack and others that it's like, you, you you're Glenn Greenwald, you did the intercept. Okay, cool. You built an audience. People have been following you, you go create a sub staff, but that doesn't necessarily work for everyone. And like, if anything, it might not really work at, it might not be long-term sustainable. So this idea of creating a token, having a group of fans of yours and readers of yours actually own that token, have that token to get access to your newsletter, had that token to maybe redeem merchandise that you have or whatever you end up doing with that. Or like, you know, you have an early album release, you can give it to your early fans who hold X of tokens. I think there's a lot of fun stuff you can play with in that. And I think that's really creating a community around a content creator is probably more important than having like, you know, a Twitter account associated with them. I think having the fans also get to know each other, even like a DAO format, I think eventually you're going to kind of see these, uh, content creators have like DAOs where their communities will also have like this financial mobility where they can like come together and create merchandise and sell that merchandise to the community for that, you know, sub token. So I think that there's some fun stuff to play with content creators. I'm super interested in that space where, you know, we're seeing that a little bit here and there a few people in the crypto space have started tokenizing themselves. There's a few token based communities like on discord, what you need, you know, X amount of tokens to enter the discord, um, a few members, like if you have a certain token amount, you can be a multi-stakeholder and make, you know, based on vote, like make certain capital allocation. So I think we're slowly seeing the emergence of that, but I think for a certain content creator that you could create like fully a brand around a token. And so I think that's pretty, pretty interesting and, and likely we'll pop off this year. Um, I think there's a lot of talk.\n\nDAVE: Right. And why is that important? Why do you find that compelling? \n\nPRI: I find it compelling. And I think why it made sense to me immediately was actually after talking to Bradley Abelow, I mean, I, at first I was a little skeptical. I'm like, ah, I don't know how I feel about this, this idea of someone just like, you know, creating shares of themselves. Like that seems so strange. Like they're beholden to this audience. Like I don't know how I feel about it. And then I talked to Bradley Abelow we were just chatting a little bit and it kind of just made it started making more sense to me after having like deeper conversations. I mean, like right now, if you think about it, many of these content creators, whether that be like Instagram, Instagram influencers or Twitter influencers, a lot of them are beholden to like sponsored content. A lot of them get their money from these third parties, which actually in many ways is like not even authentic to themselves or their audience. So, um, if you ha if you give them the ability to completely circumvent all of that, to like survive and have a token that not only can yes, support themselves, but also give them and their audience, the ability to like run with that community and give them autonomy of that community rather than again, being beholden to some third party, I think is pretty, pretty powerful and will likely like, again, it's, you are, you have to kind of keep that community engaged and keep it going. But I do think the alternative of like having to sell something on your Instagram, just, I think that's a little outdated. And so having like this community and sub-communities all in your domain currency is pretty powerful. And, and what I like even like about that is the subcultures that can emerge within your own community. I mean, they could even fork off and, and like, you could be like, I'm, I'm X content creator. And there's a group of super fans that are like, okay, like why don't we create, um, merge for X? Uh, we'll make it all like bought and sold, um, in, in this token and, and people like it'll only grow the network value if people are transacting in that token. So I think that's pretty powerful and there's a lot that can be done there. And I just liked the idea of that. I think, um, there's just going to be more and more of that. It's like really decentralizing Reddit communities in many ways.\n\nJACK: Do you, do you like the idea more so of the fact that you can connect the content creator with the community? So like for example, Kanye with the people that follow and listen to Kanye West, the idea of cutting out Spotify, cutting out Apple music, which of those two ideas is the reason that you like it? Or is it a combination of both? Yeah.\n\nPRI: Yeah. It's definitely both. I mean, the thing with the tokens is like, you know, Kanye doesn't even need to necessarily approve the token. Like you could have a person who, you know, is a mega fan and can rally a bunch of Kanye people. Obviously it'd be better if, if Kanye was a part of that, you could retroactively give the Kanye token to all of his followers and it would just kind of build momentum and, and kind of like-minded people who are all part of the community. So, I mean, I think that makes sense, but as far as like the record labels and you know, what's going on with Apple music and Spotify, which I know a lot of people have been writing about and talking about as being like tremendously extractive, you know, there are a lot of musicians that don't even put their albums on Spotify, but now also they're like kind of, strong-armed putting them because they're like missing out all this money. Because everyone, you know, buys and listens to music through Spotify. So they don't really have a choice. And so I think giving people options, like it's just too, it's like the creators actually end up losing in this because they just don't have many options, which is unfortunate. So it's not like they have that mobility, um, to really like even weave that. So, I mean, you're stuck to these kind of warm siloed relationships that music musicians have with the streamers and the record labels. It just kind of, you know, along for this, and I think this kind of cuts outside of that, it could be in parallel to it, but it does free them up quite a bit. So I mean, like, you know, I don't think Spotify is per going anywhere, but I would love to see actually eventually is having like back to the Apple music days where you paid like 99 cents for a song, like if you could have like micro, micro, micro transactions and pay, like instead of paying Spotify, like nine bucks a month, you could just like pay like a 10th of a cent to listen to a song or whatever. I think something like that will emerge and that'll be interesting, but, you know, the way it sits now. Yeah. I mean, I do think that this is something that musicians can do and it's not, it's more of like, like I was saying in parallel to, to this behemoth that is like Apple music and Spotify and labels and all of that. Like,  I don't see this as like per se antagonistic to labels. So it perhaps that could be a good edge in as far as changing the industry.\n\nJACK: Is that something that you're going to devote some time to this coming year? Or where, where are you going to devote your time to?\n\nPRI: And the social token space just kind of casually, like I've found it super interesting. And so I started participating in a few communities of people who had been talking pretty deeply about this stuff. You know, the, through that and through some of what the LAO members have expressed interest in. I think a lot of people see social tokens or community tokens as the next frontier in this space. I mean, I guess perhaps not the next frontier, but something that's like an emergent trend. A lot more people are doing it. Uh, we saw, we were seeing some fairly prominent like musicians start thinking about it. We've gotten some feedback on, on, from some musicians as well that are interested in moving in this direction. We saw RAC tokenize, himself a few months back, and that was really successful and they have some really fun things. It, you know, planned on how to actually use a token. Um, so like, and like what they can do with it, what the utility of this token will be. And so the Portugal, the man, I think this past week tokenized, um, themselves. And so I think we're going to see a lot more of that. And I, if anything, I think it's going to be a huge way to, I think it's going to be a major factor in getting a lot of young people and perhaps non-native crypto users on boarded into crypto. I think that this, this, this idea of decentralizing content creators from a platform. And again, I didn't really touch on this, but this is like the token allows a content creator to port onto whatever platform they want. So like, if they don't want to be an Instagram, they can take their audience elsewhere. And I think that's pretty powerful, but I think this ability to create a community around a token and give it, empower the community, use the token, or use that token to, you know, engage your community and reward them. It is going to just be a huge phenomenon that happens like in the next year. I'm , I feel very strongly about that fact. I do think it's definitely something we're going to see. And actually on our side, we're thinking about a DAO specific to social token. So the members could basically pull together a capital and support various content creators or artists and provide capital for a specific social token. So that's something that we've discussed and I know a lot of members seem to be interested in, but yeah, I think that it's going to be big this year. And like I said, I think it's just going to get so many people interested into this.\nAnd like, I tried to talk to my friends about these ideas and whether or not they make sense, like I even get some skepticism on this idea of like digital art and like, to your point, like, well, why not just screenshot it? Or like, what's the point, but with the social tokens and like community tokens, I, I think a lot of people's feedback is like, Oh, that actually does make sense. I kind of, I can see that. So I can imagine a world where like JENZY and other Tiktok type of influencers are starting to move in this direction. So let's stay tuned there. Maybe like Kanye will have his own token this year.\n\nJACK: Yeah, definitely. And if you do make some headways in finding out the next trends, or if you're going to post those on Twitter and whatnot, where should we follow you? If you have a community token that you release, where should we go find that?\n\nPRI: I haven't done that. But maybe, maybe once maybe if I make it one day I'll, I'll, I'll issue a pre token. But, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I try to, you know, post fun articles that I read and random thoughts PRI Desai on Twitter.\n\nJACK: That's the end of our episode of high definition.

It's a pleasure to have you here. Maybe you just start off by telling us a little bit about yourself and your background.\n\nNICK: Sure, yeah. I'm Nick Johnson, currently the founder and lead developer of ENS -  Ethereum Name Service. I've been working in blockchain and the Ethereum space for about probably about three and a half years now. I first got into it, when I was working at Google as a security and privacy engineer, and got contacted by a recruiter for our large well known financial services company saying ‘Hey, would you like to come work with us on Ethereum?’ And I went, No, no, but this Ethereum thing sounds interesting, and started looking into it and then playing around with it. And next thing I knew I was getting invited to interview for the Ethereum foundation to become a core developer. Subsequent to that, I worked on Go Ethereum for a bit and then started working quite quickly on what is now the Ethereum name service. And basically the sort of looking at the user experience for Ethereum. And sort of going, why are we dealing with these long, obscure, difficult to type and impossible to remember cryptographic identifiers instead of human readable names like we do on the internet, and start developing something to try and fix that. And that gradually expanded to become a full time job, and then eventually got spun out into its own organization which I now run.\n\nJACK: Nice. So let's let's go into a bit of detail about the Ethereum foundation. How does that interaction occur? So this was back in 2017 And is there a headquarters you go to? Is it working from home environment? What does that actually look like?\n\nNICK: Yes, so very much so. The Ethereum Foundations very early days were somewhat more sort of physically co-located in Switzerland. But by the time I joined, they were very much a decentralized organization and the physical sense. And so that meant, you know, everybody's a contract, everybody's in various places around the world, you basically work from home or wherever suits you best. They haven't had a few people who sort of semi migratory and move around as they see fit. And that's not a problem they've had at various points, offices in various places. But it's very much an organization that sort of very decentralized, very sort of not focused around a single location. \n\nJACK: And did that work well, being from New Zealand, and imagining that you stay in New Zealand at this time.\n\nNICK: So at the time, I was actually living in London, and they, by the time I joined, they didn't have a London office anymore. And it was definitely a bit of a transition for me from full time work for a company where you know, the bulk of the time, you're expected to go into the office, to the sort of entirely sort of work from home type thing. I picked up a space in a coworking space and had a desk that I went into, you know, most days for most working hours and found that sort of helped with, with focus with making it seem more like an ordinary job and with having some colleagues, even if they work for different companies on different things. At the time, I was also doing some electronic stuff on the side. So it enabled me to do all of that as well. But it was definitely a big transition from working full time for a company like Google, that's for sure.\n\nDAVID: Yeah, so maybe go into it. What were the biggest differences? And what was maybe that what were the culture shocks for you?\n\nNICK: Well, the biggest difference I thought would be the fact that I was now a contractor. So, you know, Bill by the hour have to keep timesheets, you know, no holiday pay, you know, no, no benefits in terms of sick leave or anything like that. I guess that was actually a smaller impact for me than then I thought it would be. The bigger impacts was really sort of moving away from a place where I had a lot of workmates who worked on similar things and you'd go out to lunch with them and, you know, have long conversations about what you're working on or about side projects or what you're doing at home and stuff like that to a situation where I was the only person doing what I was doing in the city I was in and having a co working space and going in and working with just other people who are working on other stuff I think made a big difference to that took a little while to get to know people and so forth. But once I had, you find that actually a lot of that social aspect isn't really related that closely to the work you're doing. It's much more about connecting with people who interest you and you interest them and having interesting conversations, which as often as not, you don't want to talk about work anyway because you've been doing it all day. So, I guess in in many ways, it was less of an impact than I thought you have to be fairly sort of prepared to be fairly self-motivating and, you know, self-driven, and so forth and be happy with working independently for long periods, we would have daily and weekly stand ups and so forth and calls. And fortunately, at the time, the Ethereum team was, or sorry, the Go Ethereum team was all pretty much located in Europe, which made, you know, time zones rules as much easier. But aside from that, most of your time is spent working independently and so forth. So it's a very, it can be good for focus. You don't have many distractions. But it can also be pretty bad for focus, because it's very easy to distract yourself, you know, and I think I sort of saw both sides of that coin at various points.\n\nJACK: And talking about Go Ethereum and what exactly is that? What compelled you to go there?\n\nNICK: So Go Ethereum is the most popular, most widely used Ethereum client, it's the team has is paid by the Ethereum foundation to build and develop it. And sort of, I guess, the, the standard and most heavily used client, but most others are measured up against. At the time, when I joined the team, there was a lot of competition with parity, which was, you know, run by another company, building their own client. They've since moved that into community control. And I'd say, although there are more clients around today, Go Ethereum probably is more dominant now than it was then, although with things like Turbo GIF and so on taking some focus away, that may not continue indefinitely, who knows. And so, my job being hired on as a core developer was to work on that team, building new features, improving performance, fixing bugs, dealing with anything that came up. So for instance, we my second Devcon, in Shanghai. And the night before, at about three or 4am, I get a phone call from Hudson, who most people will know from the Ethereum Foundation. I was the only one he could reach because I guess I was the only one whose phone wasn’t on silent in the middle of the night. And somebody was DOSing - conducting a denial of service attack against the Ethereum chain, because they've discovered some bugs in both Go Ethereum and in sort of the Ethereum specification as a whole, that they've managed to find a way to basically pay to take the Ethereum chain offline and make it effectively unusable. So the job of a core dev then was to rush over to the hotel next door wherever else was staying, convince the hotel night staff that they should wake up all of their guests because of the say so someone they've never seen before by calling them and that yes, it really was it sort of emergency. And then all conveen in the only open conference room at five in the morning to try and debug and fix this thing before Devcon opens with big fanfare. And oh, by the way, our entire chain is down which fortunately didn't happen, thanks to the hard efforts of everybody on the team. So you know, it was an interesting job. It wasn't always a hurried or rushed one that was more the exception. But it was very engaging. And it was a lot of fun to be working on something so crucial, and so essential to Ethereum's success.\n\nDAVID: Yeah, so maybe go there. What is the mindset of a core dev who has to effectively stop the fires in a time of crisis like that.\n\nNICK: I think it's very much the exception rather than the rule, like in the time Ethereum has been up, we've had perhaps, you know, two or three instances like that. And a few more that have been lower key, but still important. You know, they're, the ones you don't really hear about until afterwards, where someone submits a vulnerability report to the Ethereum Foundation's bounty address. And, you know, it gets triage and determined that Oh, yes, this is an actual bug in the live chain. And then you have to try and fix it in a way that minimizes potential collateral damage, which can mean you know, sometimes doing things like pushing out effects disguised as something else, or you know, just not mentioning what it's doing, or making it look like it's just, you know, we did a bit of cleanup and we found this little typo or something, but an actual fact that fixes a major bug, and try and get that out there. So that when you disclose the vulnerability as of course, you have to, it's already a non-issue for most people, because otherwise you have this risk that somebody discloses a bug, you fix it, and then in the interval between you fixing it and everyone in the new software, it gets exploited. And, you know, the nature of Ethereum, and so forth is that maybe you could convince everyone oh, yes, this was a terrible bug, we were already on the way to fixing it, we should go back and fix all the stuff that was broken, you know, in the meantime, but that's really not a Pandora's Box you want to open it sort of situation you ought to be in that these sort of things were more the exception, most of the work as a Core Div is, you know, sitting down, determining what features you need, you know, you want to add what things are important to users, what things you think would be useful, building those, or, you know, working through thorny performance issues, and so forth. So I spent a lot of time when I was on the team, for instance, working on trying to improve optimization of writing storage to disk, dealing with trying to deal with garbage collection. So cleaning up old state that was no longer needed, which is theoretically possible by the design of Ethereum, but wasn't exactly made easy. By the way it was designed. You know, it was a particularly thorny, difficult to shoot. I'm a bit embarrassed to say that although I made headway, that wasn't an effort I managed to complete before I left the team, and other smarter people than me, finished it up after I'd moved on to working on ENS full time.\n\nDAVID: Right, and maybe talk about what it looks like to get recruited into the Ethereum foundation? Who kind of contacts you and what is does whole process look like?\nNICK: Like, I can't remember who the initial point of contact he reached out to me was, it was probably Hudson, because he's the person who does that sort of thing and has for a long time. But the interview process was interviews with, you know, with leaders from the Ethereum foundation. And also with, you know, the team lead and other team members of the team I would be on, and just sort of phone interviews and talking about experience, and, you know, how would you deal with this sort of thing, and, you know, the usual hypotheticals, they weren't big into the whole, you know, whiteboard coding, you know, here is a sample problem, or, you know, here is a completely contrived, you know, computer science thing for you to solve, which, you know, would have been a bit a little more difficult to do remotely, but it was it was mostly I think they were judging based on my published record of what I've done online, and the contributions I'd already made to the Ethereum community, and even just talking to me, really.\n\nDAVID: yeah, makes sense. So maybe step back, I guess, into, I guess, your role at Google, and I guess, you know, the prior background, and how might be different from the role that you kind of fit into today.\n\nNICK: Yes, so my, my career leading up to working for Ethereum, Foundation was mostly software engineering, and mostly for, you know, for standard companies as a standard employee, basically, I grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand, and sort of concurrently with doing my campsite degree, picked up a job at a local software company that ended up becoming basically, you know, went from part time to full time, actually ended up dropping out of university to pursue it full time, work there for a while, and another company here in Christchurch, and then moved overseas, mostly to work for Google. They hired me to go work for them in Dublin as a site reliability engineer. That's their role where basically, your job is to take the pages at six in the morning when something goes down. And your job during the day is to maintain and improve the production infrastructure so that you don't get paged as much as six in the morning and stuff doesn't go down. So we were part of a team, maintaining the big table service, the massive scale database infrastructure inside Google. And, you know, we were split between two or three locations and had to sort of maintain that and, you know, improve the infrastructure, improve the monitoring, keep everything up, and so on. And I did that for about 18 months, just determined that it sorry .wasn't really my thing. Like I enjoy software engineering more than I enjoy production. But I'm still very glad I did it because I learned an enormous amount about building robust production systems. In fact, Google has or at least had a system called Mission Control. And the idea there was that software engineers for a product would sort of rotate onto the SRE team for, you know, six to 12 months, and spend the time doing that, and learning how SRE works and how production systems work and so on before they go back to their software engineering role. So I kind of view what I did as almost like an extended version of that. And it really is experience I recommend to everyone is take some time to, to learn how the practical implications of how your software actually runs and what things you can do to make it more robust and more, more durable. For instance, one of the unintuitive, things I learned was that you're much better off building software that if it gets to a state where it's like encounters a bug, that should never happen, or something like that, you're generally actually better off having it just fail and die than you are having a try and recover and continue on. Because if it fails and dies, your production systems log that and you know, depending on the severity, you send an alert or at least you know, keep some logs, and then automatically restarted. And you can come in the morning and go on died three times overnight. Let's find out why. If it recovers and keeps going on, then maybe there's something broken in the internal state and it starts serving up incorrect results or just behaving poorly. And so instead you get paged at four in the morning, and you've got some bizarre bug that is almost impossible to diagnose because it's related to something that happened six hours ago when it should have died, but didn't. So things like that are really valuable lessons that I learned. So after doing that, I moved on to the Google App Engine team. And this time I in a role as a developer programs engineer, which is Google speak for the person who built API's, who documents those API's who writes apps that use them so that other developers can look at them and see how they work. And who reaches out to like the developer community outside Google and helps them build apps and answer questions, and so on, so forth. So I did that for about four years, I think, and was one of the first people to join the App Engine team, you know, before launch, like the first people in that that sort of role helped develop some of its initial API's helped sort of shape it before launch. And then after launch, you know, worked with developers outside Google and help them build stuff, and so on. And that was an enormously rewarding role. I think that's some of the most the most I enjoyed my career. So far, in many regards. That was something that was Yeah, just enormously rewarding. So for a long time, my, my job in large part involved going on Stack Overflow, and answering questions and stuff like that. If Stack Overflow, reputation point were air miles, I think I'd be able to fly a very long way by now.\nAnd so that was what I did for a long time before moving away from Google for a bit. I moved to Sydney while I was still on the app in general, to be closer to home, lift Google worked at some startups, moved to London after meeting my now wife, elsewhere, she lived in London. So I moved over there and lived there for a good four years, went back to Google and the security and privacy team worked there for a while and then we're up to now you know, now when I quit and joined the Ethereum foundation.\n\nJACK: So let's talk about the startups for a bit. What were the startups? What did you learn from the startups? And maybe what did you take over to apply to ENS?\n\nNICK: So without being completely exhaustive, the main one I worked at was one in London called Lumi. And they were building a sort of a social recommendations engine, that today would look quite quaint, but at the time was really, you know, cutting edge and it basically, you installed a browser extension, it logged sites you were visiting, and then it used that to generate recommendations of other content that you'd find interesting. You know, at the time, that was a combination of like, Is this too invasive? And is this not smart enough? Now, if you'd like pull up your Android phone and swipe to the right, you probably get like exactly those sort of recommendations except better authored. And it so we sort of slogged away at that for a good while. And I guess what I learned, like it was good to once again, I was lucky enough to have a team of other people I was working with, who were good engineers who are interesting people who are nice to work with, you know, I make friends who I still have today. It was very similar to my early experience, working at a small company in New Zealand, it didn't really feel like there was that much of a difference between working at a so called startup which is supposed to be growth orientated and everything and just working at a small company. And it had many of the same pitfalls with you know, things being a little less structured, you know, a little more vulnerable to a bit rotten to you know, poor maintenance and so on because the word you know, the systems in place to keep things you know, well-structured and so forth. And the vague Rates of management, you know, when the founder is your boss, and he decides, oh, I think we want to do this thing. Instead, you know, it basically you're at the mercy of how level headed and consistent they are for like how good your work environment was. And that was both, you know, pros and cons at various times. So, I guess my startup experience was, in some ways, like less exciting than, you know, than the stereotypical, you know, Silicon Valley TV show type, type thing. It's not the only startup I've worked at. But broadly speaking, I'd say those things have mostly held all of them, in contrast to my first software engineering job offered some sort of like theoretical equity, and all of them, it worked out to be, they would have to go like ridiculously to the moon and get bought up by some enormous company for a ridiculous amount to even like, worry about it. So they offer less money in return for equity, that probably doesn't mean anything. But on the plus side, like Google, when I first joined it, and when I was working on the App Engine team, I really liked his work environment. But as I was there, it did gradually evolve to become more corporate and less accepting of input from sort of the bottom up and more sort of hierarchical. And that was something that none of the startups or small companies I worked at either suffered from.\n\nDAVID: Yeah, and maybe talk to the, I guess the, the motivation, or for compensation of someone in a startup? Is it just about building new technology? Or was it for you? Or is it more about kind of thinking about more materially being compensated for the work you provide?\n\nNICK: It, it definitely wasn't about the money for me. And you know, that there are startup opportunities for people where, you know, there's a small chance of a high reward sort of thing. But I think that, for that, you really have to be very early, like one of the first few people, and you have to pick something with that in mind, which is not necessarily what's going to be the most interesting thing to work for, you know, if you're motivated mostly, by compensation, you could probably, you know, try and get hired by a high speed trading firm or something like that, and get paid ridiculous amounts of money and never sleep and never see your family, if you have one, and so forth. Trying to find a startup, like my, my motivation was finding one that's trying to solve interesting problems and do interesting things. And, you know, the, generally for that I was, I was looking at least than I could be being paid to work at Google or whatever, but hopefully doing more interesting work. Which is not what they sell you on, you know, in terms of the compensation package, they want to tell you, oh, yeah, we're gonna be huge, Google's gonna buy our, so Facebook's gonna buy us or, you know, we're just gonna, we're gonna get investment, and then all of our user base is going to explode, and we're going to be massively successful. For me, I think you're better off asking yourself, like, will I enjoy working here, even if things don't go, you know, to the moon. And I found generally, that's a pretty reliable way of picking a place you didn't enjoy working.\n\nJACK: So let's move to ENS now. What sort of takeaways did you gather from Lumi, and the other startups and even Google, that you applied to ENS to make sure that you read it? \n\nNICK: Right. I guess the main things I've tried to learn, I never intended to be a manager to run an organization to, you know, much less be any sort of founder, my, my, my own skills are mostly focused around software engineering, and development and technical communication, which, you know, as a result of my, my work on App Engine, I discovered I'm quite good at. So I think the main things I learned from small organizations like that is how to step out of people's way, how to sort of be able to set direction and, and let people build stuff, without, you know, micromanaging without trying to, you know, shift direction every 30 seconds, you know, my first job in software engineering, I was hampered continually by, you know, a manager who, once a week or maybe every other day would decide that, Oh, actually, no, this is the new top priority, you know, leave that thing have finished, or just get it out the door and move on to this other thing with no sort of general direction. So, I don't pretend to be the ideal person running any sort of organization. But I think that learning to avoid those pitfalls, because I've experienced them myself. And because I've had managers who have done better, is probably valuable experience and also just finding people who have the skills you don't and trusting them to do a good job. You know, you can keep an eye on how things are going and provide feedback and so forth. But the more you middle, you know, the more you sort of try and get involved and fixing every little thing as it happens, kind of the worse it gets rather than the better.\n\nDAVID: Yeah, definitely, and maybe go into ENS a bit deeper now, what's really the core problem that you're solving? And where do you see it going.\n\nNICK: So the core idea behind ENS is like, if you open your web browser, and you go to google.com, you type in google.com, into your browser bar. And what happens behind the scenes is, that gets turned into a machine readable ID that then you know, an IP address, which then you know, does all sorts of stuff with behind the scenes. But as an end user, you don't have to worry about that. And if you try and imagine what the internet would be like, without DNS, it would be effectively unusable, you know, we would not have the adoption, the universal use that we see today, because it would have remained forever, the domain of people who were sufficiently technically orientated that they were happy with dealing with the sort of terrible user interface. So ultimately, it's a usability issue. And crypto in general, has the same usability issue in spades, because instead of being, you know, four dotted numbers, and Ethereum, addresses 40 hexidecimal characters. And what's worse, unlike Bitcoin addresses has no sort of checksum. So if you type it wrong, then you know, good luck, you just sent your ether off into the ether. So it's a massive issue. And it's one that platforms at least at the time weren't even attempting to address. You know, they were basically bullying built this infrastructure and oh uses cryptographic identifiers everywhere, because they're what the underlying platform uses. And we're not even going to try and wrap them in layer makes it easier for users. And that seemed like a really obvious thing to fix. And thanks to the power of Ethereum, the fact that it's a programmable platform, it was actually tractable, to fix that as part of Ethereum and by building on top of Ethereum. So he needs his basic idea is make decentralized resources, like Ethereum addresses human friendly, by wrapping them up in a layer of human readable names. That makes it so much easier for us to exchange those that sort of information with each other to book market, to write it down, all those sort of things. And although we focused entirely on Ethereum addresses start and it now expands to much more than that it supports other sorts of cryptographic addresses, you know, Bitcoin addresses, or pretty much every major chain. And it supports decentralized identifiers for things like IPFS content and other decentralized storage systems. So that you can load websites associated with DNS addresses and so forth. So, you know, in short, the basic idea is, no user should have to see a long obscure, you know, non human readable identifier, unless they want to, you know, unless they're dealing with a sort of low level stuff that involves that directly, just the same as true with the internet today.\n\nDAVID: Right. And I guess what motivated you personally to begin, I guess, solving that problem to start with.\n\nNICK: So first of all, when I first started working for the Ethereum Foundation, I worked a bit with the swarm team. And swarm is a distributed content system similar to IPFs. And that was one of the big issues they were dealing with, because if it's, you know, bad for Ethereum addresses, it's worse for having a website with no human readable name. And I've always been motivated to write and build API's and developer tooling, and that sort of back end stuff. And so that fits in well with what interested me. And I also have a reasonable amount of experience with low level protocols like DNS, so I was already very familiar with how DNS functioned. And it seemed a natural step to build a naming system that, you know, that use that knowledge. And then that built on top of the specific structure of Ethereum to build something that was sort of crypto native rather than, you know, the DNS system, which is designed in the 80s for a different entity than we have today.\n\nJACK: And how did you transition your time management from working at Ethereum foundation to ENS was it, I quit the job and immediately start and hope for the best all I slow transition,\n\nNICK: it was a bit more of a slow transition, the initially I was you know full time on on swarm and go then go with Ethereum. And I built the Ethereum name service as kind of a side project. And as that started growing and traction and usefulness, you know, I was able to dedicate more of my own time to that to the point where I was working at Ethereum Foundation, but nominally pretty much 100% on Ethereum ENS. And at that point, it was still a one person project. And the Ethereum foundation reached out to me and basically said, Well, you know, that the managing director reached out to me and said, You know, ENS could grow beyond just you. It's a significant project that has a lot of We are experimenting with sort of effectively sort of outsourcing decentralizing the Ethereum foundation. What do you think about forming your own organization for Ethereum Foundation, and we will give you a substantial grant to get you started as an independent organization that can then you know, for to hire people and work on ns independently of our oversight, more or less, and then go from there. So that was pretty much what we did we formed ENS. Well, what we formed was an organization called True names, which is incorporated in Singapore, it's a not for profit. And we hired some people to work on ENS, which, which was easier than it might have been, because we already had several volunteer contributors who are doing amazing work. And so we were able to just approach them and say, you know, you're doing amazing work ENS is growing, would you like to join us full time and get paid to do this? And they pretty much universally accepted? So we had a much easier hiring pipeline than most. And then yeah, the Ethereum Foundation gave us a grant in two parts, total of a million US dollars, that enabled us to, to run for several years, you know, building ns are a couple of years at any rate, building ENS independently of them\n\nJACK: RIGHT, and what does that sort of agreement look like? Is it just it is a grant with no strings attached, or that deadlines you have to meet as well, that comes along with it,\n\nNICK: Relatively few strings attached. The basic idea was they gave us the first half of the ground. After we, together set a bunch of milestones and goals. And then when we met the milestones and goals, they released the second half of the grant to us, and I think was the first step first grant, we did a pretty good job of setting goals that were achievable, but not trivial. And so we built our, we set to do with, you know, sort of 90% success, and then they made the second half available, and that funded us for a good time following that.\n\nJACK: Right. And at this point, you are now managing people rather than being deep in the code, or was it a bit of both?\n\nNICK: I've always tried to focus as much my time on still writing code as I can, and  to, you know, on to today, even there are skill sets at ENS, so that I'm sort of the only person who, you know, who has solidly or who, you know, has the time and the combination of skillsets to work on. I don't really want to be a full time manager and our group, you know, our team of four plus a couple of part timers are small enough that I don't think that's, that's necessary. But it's definitely taken up more of my time then don't have in the past.\n\nDAVID: Right, and where do you see, at the risk of being kind of pie in the sky? What do you see the project going? And what do you think, I guess the future could look like for, I guess, the decentralized web, if you will?\n\nNICK: Well, so ENS vision since we started, his is definitely expanded. You know, we started off focusing primarily on two things, it was addressing decentralized content like swarm and IPFs. And it was Ethereum addresses. And our vision now is basically that Ethereum should be sort of the crypto native name resolution service. So that means you know, any cryptographic identify any decentralized system should be addressable with it. But we can also do things like integrate with DNS in both directions. So if you have a DNS name, you can use it inside DNS like an ENS name. And also, if you have DNS content, like a website, you can point to it from an ENS name. So that alone gives us you know, certainly a lot of things to build out and a lot of adoption to work on. On top of that, when we're now working on layer two support, because as you'll be aware, layer one on Ethereum is pretty congested. In Ethereum, name, like names that have five characters and longer cost $5 a year to register. And at the moment, gas fees for registration are more than 10 times that. So you're paying five bucks for a year's registration and 50 bucks just for the gas fees to submit that. So that's something we're focusing on quite heavily at the moment. The recent appreciation and ether price has given us put us in a good position because the bulk of our funds these days are in terms of past registration fees, which are controlled by multi SIG, which is a number of independent entities. And although that's not our money, we can request it in the form of sort of grants from them. And that Treasury is now a lot larger. So we feel like we're in a safe position to look at hiring another couple of people to expand the team a bit and to be able to do all of this faster as well.\n\nJACK: And you always hear how high gas fees impact the users, the single individuals that are using Ethereum and the applications that it provides. What does it do for impacting the revenue of a company like ENS? Are you seeing less users uptaking ENS names? Or is that a really non-factor?\n\nNICK: So I mean, I guess first I should clarify that true names the company I ran, and that does the development doesn't directly receive revenue for name registrations, right? The ENS route is, is governed by a group of seven key holders. I'm one of them, the other six are unaffiliated with ENS, their job is to sort of safeguard any changes to the route to those that are like bug fixes and upgrades, and so forth and generally be non-interfering. They also control the funds that are collected from registrations, and it's their job to decide where their goals and so far, nobody's requested funds, often ourselves included, because we've been able to function without that, in terms of the impacts that guests fees have on that revenue. It's been smaller than we would have expected actually, you know, given that they now significantly overwhelm the actual cost of registration, we've been surprised to note that most users are seem to be happy to continue to register names, even at much inflated prices. It's difficult to answer the counterfactual and say like, how many registrations would we have of guests fees or a 10th of what they are today, but at first glance, at least, it's had less of an impact than I would have expected.\n\nDAVID: Right? And I guess what's, what's the next big thing for you guys, what's the next big thing that you see on the radar on the roadmap.\n\nNICK: The really big focus for us at the moment is layer 2 support. And the way we're doing that is, we're building out a sort of a general infrastructure for, for layer two support for any play any system that needs to be able to query state from L2. And the way that works is it was originally proposed by VItalik Buterin, in a post that he shared with us, and we've had a couple of community workshops, we've expanded on and improved that and generalized it. And the basic way it works is that if you give me back up a little bit. The general idea is that ENS needs to work in such a way that a single client can resolve any ENS name, which means that it's a bit of a nonstarter to say, we've got we support two dozen different L2S. And each of them has a different resolution process, and every client needs to implement every one of them. So we needed some system that was generic. And so what we're building is one where effectively what happens is the client goes off, and it queries the main ENS registry on our one. And of course, queries are free, because they aren't making changes. And it says, Who should I consult to resolve, you know, Token.eth. And it comes back with the address of a gateway service. And that gateway services specific to the L2 to that token.ethernet subdomains are hosted on. So then the client goes off and asks that gateway service, hey, what does bob.token resolve to? And it goes off, and it queries, it's specific L2, it gets an answer, and it returns it to the caller. And so, you know, with those two steps, you'd have something that arguably works, but you'd be trusting that that gateway is answering accurately and honestly. And so the third step is that it goes back to the original contract on L1, but it consulted to get the gateway address. And it says, here's the answer the gateway gave me and here's some proof data that the gateway gave me that it claims proves this answers correct. And then that contracts can execute smart contract code to verify that proof. And because of the nature of L2s like optimism, and so forth, those are optimistic roll ups are in fact, just roll ups in general, it's actually possible to generate proofs that can be verified on the Ethereum chain independently, and without adding any additional trust assumptions. So the result then, is that we've got a system where anyone can build a gateway to they're able to have choice. And clients can query these gateways without having to know which, which L2 the gateway to without even having to know like, any details about it, get back a result and verify that result independently and know that the there are no trust assumptions here, you're not relying on, you know, some sort of trusted multisig or anything like that. So that's what we're building for ENS resolution. But it's also going to be really useful for any other application that needs to be able to read data from multiple L2 And verify that the results are correct. And so that's a short term solution. The other advantage is that it helps us avoid having to pick a winner for L2S. It's I think, far too early in the day to say, you know, this particular solution is going to be dominant. And if we picked one and said Oh, ENS is going to work with this L2 exclusively, there's a very high chance we end up sort of, you know, the Betamax of the future. You know, solutions, this way we can we can let 1000 flowers bloom people can build on whatever they want. And they will just continue to work as long as those solutions are available.\n\nDAVID: Right. It's exciting, and where can people go and find you?\n\nNICK: So the main site is ENS.domains that has all the information about ENS in general, if you want to join the discussion discuss.ens.domains is our discourse instance, we're trying to be as open as possible with stuff we're working on and our plans and so forth. So we will frequently post things they're seeking feedback on, on things we're considering improving or doing and gather community feedback on that that's, you know, often productive and sometimes contentious, as is the nature of decentralized governance. We also have a discord linked from any sort of domains, which is, you know, a combination of support and tech support and feedback and so forth. And of course, you can follow us on Twitter @ensdomains\n\n\nDavid: Well, thanks very much for your time.\n\nNICK:  My pleasure. \n\nJACK: Thank you, Nick. Beautiful. \n\nNICK: My pleasure. \n\nJACK: Beautiful. Beautiful. That was really good. I liked that.\n"}},{"node":{"captivate_link":"https://player.captivate.fm/episode/524171a3-b8b2-4ccb-83ee-962b1f883471","description":"Like all of the guests on High Definition, DeFi Dad has a serious appetite for new knowledge. It was only a matter of time before his desire to make a mark and help others make their mark led him to DeFi.\n\nAfter finishing a chemistry PhD, DeFi Dad pivoted into a completely different world by establishing a cookie baking business on the West Coast.

And let me know if I, if I go back far enough, because I want to, I want to share, I think the origin of some of the skills I actually use today, which weirdly connect back to even like going back to college. So I would say, speaking at a high level in terms of like where I'm from, I'm from a very like, middle of the country of the United States. I, I grew up in a very middle class home. Money was never an issue. But we were not wealthy. I thought we were because growing up middle class in the United States in the 90s, especially, you felt rich, like you live the same life as everyone else. We had great public schools, we all lived in nice houses in the area that I lived in, which again, like think of like the Midwest, of the United States. And I mean, my, I had like a very awesome sort of childhood, like, so I was, I was very lucky, I always was a good student in school, always enjoyed learning, which is something that, like, it's a characteristic that clearly defines who I am today. It's just weird, because it was more of like, I just want to learn for the sake of making mom and dad happy at that point in my life. But now, of course, I've more discovered, like the joy of learning for myself. So it's a little more selfish, I think now, but I ended up going to, I would say a very prestigious school in the in the US, it's, it's definitely ranked top five most days. And that school that I went to, I studied chemistry. And so my background really was I continued this sort of like learning for the sake of making mom and dad happy being like the type A personality in school, and I got to college, and I just got burned by all of the brilliant people around me. I mean, I realized, I'm really not that smart. I'm really, I mean, maybe in the grand spectrum of humanity, sure. But, but the people around me just blew me away and sort of like knocked my ego down a peg. And I ended up getting to the end of university, and I wanted to go into medicine. And then I ended up discovering that I really enjoyed chemistry. And I had a awesome mentor who sort of led me to a Chem Ph. D program. So you know, long story short, by the time I graduated, I was a very subpar chemistry student, but at a really good school, felt like I was the shittiest chemistry student in the world knew that I was good at solving problems. I had a lot of salesman, salesman skills that I had developed over the years because I have worked in my family's small business growing up. So I have like these two different lives sort of juxtaposed against one another where I'm in a lab, I'm, I'm in this like very, like high academic institution, sort of like environment learning. And then I've got this like, small business mentality where I'm selling, you know, electronics to people over the counter and having conversations with them and just, I don't know, finding a lot of joy in that. And it's, I only point this out in the early days because it's weird. I think the skills I developed working from the time I was I mean, I was in kinder garten and was like helping my father in this small business. By the time I was in high school selling, you know, electronics over the counter to folks, those skills I think have served me better than anything I've ever learned in all that, you know, the calculus classes I took and all the other bullshit I learned in quantum mechanics and crap like that. So if you fast forward, then I ended up in this Chem PhD program. So I moved from the Midwest to the west coast, did a lot of growing up over a few years, actually had a lot of joy in joining this, this chem PhD. But within a few years, while I was teaching chemistry, I was discovering again, that I kept going down this path of kind of like trying to force myself into like a like a square peg into a round hole, I wanted to suddenly be a professor. But I didn't really want to be a professor, I wanted to do research, but I didn't really want to do research. But I was enjoying the learning behind it. And I actually had my greatest joy was teaching, I was trying to keep teach chemistry to students that were like me, because I felt like no one, no one really was helping me when I was in university, no one was really like giving me that confidence that I could like, get through these incredibly challenging classes. So I took the, the opposite approach, I was very nurturing to my students, and just really trying to like, help them through and not get overwhelmed. Which again, weirdly enough, I would say that skill stat is part of I think, what has like helped me to accelerate in the last few years working in deep phi. So anyways, I get to the end of two years in grad school, I pass this very, there's this like, oral exam that you take three professors sort of like, sit there and ask you a bunch of hard questions. It's, um, it's known for making lots of students cry, students are normally like, 22 to 30, depends on how old they are starting the program. And I finished this, and I passed it, which was like a miracle to me. And then I quit, almost like weeks after I was like, I just don't belong here. Like I love chemistry, I love the learning. But I will never ever succeed as an outlier in this space. And that was a lesson along the way too, about like kind of recognizing your skill set. Just because people tell you you're doing something right and might he might not be in the right place. So then, I started to finally work in software startups. And it was, of course, starting with like my own idea, thinking that maybe I could raise money. We lived on the west coast, not in the Bay Area. So that was not that easy. And my like arrogant, 24 year old ego like thought, Oh, hey, I'll be able to do this, I'll be able to raise money, even though I don't live in Silicon Valley. And after about six months, I burned through what little money I had. So the chemistry PhD had paid me to be there. Like all physical sciences programs, you get paid to be there, you get paid very little, but still, you're paid. So you're not having to pay your tuition. So I burned through my money. And I started of all things a cookie bakery, started doing it, it was just to pay the bills, it was to like, basically make ends meet because I really felt strongly about the different. At that point, there was one software startup that I was working on, I felt really strongly about it thought we had a great idea. Started to Yeah, like sell cookies locally. We were selling them until as like a catering business but also as like a late night delivery. And these were they weren't we'd cookies, which it kind of sounds like that when I describe it. And it was, it was the best and worst experience up until that point in my life. I was I grew it to about 20 part time employees over the course of three years. I got to the point where we were even drawing up plans thinking about like trying to open up a chain of these because it was very popular with the universities where we lived. There was a lot of demand a lot of outreach for like, people wanting to franchise it. And like again, I like realized man like this, there is like no joy in this anymore. I mean, I'm working really hard. I'm barely making ends meet. I had a few mentors I was lucky to have at the time who worked in fast food chains. These were the owners of fast food chains. They had scaled them. One of them was worth hundreds of Mills. Billions of dollars. And this guy had been at it for 30 40 years. And I just kind of looked at his life and was like, I there's no way that I am going to keep the relationship I have, which eventually turned into my marriage. So, so I had met my wife during this, and she was putting up with that. And then we were, of course, thinking about, eventually we would have kids, and I was thinking about how I would handle all of that. So I guess the key take-away from that part of my life, right before I go to the Bay Area is, again, there's this theme of having conversations with people taking a genuine interest in what they have to say, being just fascinated with people. When I would travel, especially on airplanes, I carried a journal with me and I would just meet random people. And I would write, you know, journal entries about them. And I, I would unintentionally interview them, just because I was so fascinated by how people's stories were so unique. But then, like, how there was this commonality that you would find, I think, you know, I ended up throwing that journal out, I always thought I would like keep that that it would be like some sort of awesome keepsake to show someone later. But again, that is a skill set that now I'm like, okay, so part of the reason I'm doing what I do is because I love talking to anyone about defi, and I love learning from them about what they're thinking whether they have $1 in their wallet, or whether they have a million dollars. So then fast forward a few more years, we moved to the Bay Area, I'm finally close to getting into crypto here. I have ignored it up until this point in my life and Bitcoin has been born at this point. I actually had someone offered to pay me in cookies years before with Bitcoin. I'm pretty sure it was like 2011. So if you go back and you think about however much a cookie order, like a 30 $50 cookie order would be. I mean, that's it's almost like the order. Oh, that's a couple.\n \nJACK: That's a couple that's a couple.\n \nDEFI DAD:\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's a, that's a few kids, university tuitions, and probably a house or two. But I ended up in the Bay Area finally. And I started to find this groove with working with Silicon Valley, you know, companies. I worked with a marketing research company for a bit and I got to work with some really reputable names like box and Salesforce and Dropbox. And I was working with them in an advisory capacity, kind of learning what the sales marketing product leaders were doing in those companies. And then I gotta say, like, in retrospect, I didn't realize it then. I mean, I was actually really loving my job at this point. But what they did at those companies I found to be so boring, the mission I thought was boring. What they did as Jobs was fascinating to me, because, I mean, you know, good God, if you look at like the way they scale sales.\n \nJACK: What was the mission?\n \nDEFI DAD: Like to automate to automate the process of you know, collecting sales data and contact information and make revenue predictable? Like, I mean, I'm sure it was cool in the early days, but like, at this point, yeah, it was like this is business to business relationships. It's like they're gonna affect millions and millions and millions of lives but they're not gonna be able to affect what like a Bitcoin and ethereum a chain link what whatever everything that we see in like, DEFI So anyways, I'm bulldoze through a bunch of startups. I lived the, you know, the typical Silicon Valley startup experience. Most of them were just absolute shit storms, I mean, just, you know, quick experiences, learned a lot worked with a lot of volatile personalities. And in 2017, so it was the summertime. And I had a friend, thankfully at one of these startups who said, you know, hey, you know, you would really like this thing called the Ethereum. I remember specifically repeating it, I was like, Ethereum. What did you say? Is that even like a word, and then he showed me a video of VITALIK and I was like, is this guy even real? Like, because the words even like decentralization and all of all of the typical buzzwords that you use, up to that point, it was so difficult. It was so difficult to find anyone who could explain to me what is a ethereum for but I ran into bitcoin as well and I think Bitcoin at that point by like, August 2017 you know, everything was going up in price. And I was digging into podcasts and reading the white papers that were out there and stuff like that and, and was like, finally, like realizing like holy cow like this. This is something that this is something that really feels like it could change the world. And this feels like something that has economic upside, it feels like something that it's not going to just help the rich, it's not gonna, It's not like you can't help the rich to get the momentum going so that you can truly make it like a globalized technology. It just checked off all these boxes that I had never really thought about. And then I ended up going to an ethereal conference. And I think it was October 2017. I like to think I'm the only person who paid a full price ticket. Probably everyone was there for free because they had a friend, you know, who worked at consensus are one of the other companies that was there. But I went there on my own. I basically lived like the fantasy of fantasies that I had over all these years, which was, I talked about really complex problems with people that reminded me of chemistry. I got to have engaging conversations. I got to learn from people the entire day. I mean, I kept a little note in my phone, I was literally typing people's names in and trying to write down like what they did. And it's too bad. I should have kept the note original because my original thoughts were so funny to read. I clearly I didn't understand what anything was, but I was trying to make sense of decentralized. You know, like, what is a decentralized blockchain? And yeah, I got to the end of the day, and I would say like, that was a major inflection point in my life. I mean, I came home, I was already deep down the crypto rabbit hole. My wife knew this, I was putting our son to bed. So we had a baby who was just a year old. And I was putting him to bed every night and literally staying in his room for hours because I was listening to podcasts and reading. So base, I would get home from work and I would just read from the time I got home until God knows what one or 2 am I barely had any crypto at this point to I mean, I bought a tiny bit of Bitcoin, a little bit of ether. And I just was obsessed as like the most like jittery, exciting feeling. Which I think I still have today actually. But it was, it was like, I think I have found the thing I want to focus on for the rest of my life.\n \nJACK: I liked the idea of helping people through hard challenges. And that's probably a reason why you've got your TV, which is basically a platform which simplifies the complexities of a ethereum and defi. But do you think there's an argument to be made that nurturing and helping people into something that is complex? Actually inhibits their ability to learn?\n \nDEFI DAD: Yeah, do you do you mean to say they might struggle to be on boarded because of being helped too much? Or like I would be burned out from from too much effort?\n \nJACK: No, the newcomer to ethereum.\n \nDEFI DAD: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, that that's a great point, okay, so, crypto in general. So we're thinking like someone who's simply holding Bitcoin to someone who is yield farming with defi it clearly takes some curiosity. It takes some initiative to learn and to you know, to work at it to have the bravery to click Confirm on meta mask, I mean, that that is definitely something that I don't take lightly. I still remember the first time I use meta mask, I was like, This all has to be like a joke. I'm clearly like playing into like a Ponzi at this point. But yeah, I, I think what I have found really challenging, though, in like a very fulfilling way is I am trying to think every second of every day about what is the minimal amount of information that someone needs in order to have a light bulb moment that will drive them to keep learning and what is the minimal amount of information we can provide for them to actually get started with defi with crypto in general, you know, even if it just means someone again, holding some ether in their wallet. So it's a weird sort of thing. Like you can't expect the world to be the way that many of the people we know on our lives to be in crypto where, you know, in the defi community, it's filled with self-learners, people who enjoy tinkering, but will never see mass adoption if  that is required at every level. Everyone cannot be a Thinker. And I think like, without drawing too many parallels to it I, I do take some inspiration from, you know, the usual places like when you look at the, you know, the mass adoption of personal computers, and you look at smartphones, and you look at the Internet, and you say, on day one, were less tech savvy people using this, this technology. No, they clearly were not using it. It took, you know, people who were brave enough to try it. And then to evangelize it. What I find most fulfilling about that is just that no matter how much progress we make, I am never satisfied with I'm never satisfied with any of the milestones. I mean, defi at 1 billion was huge. And I just immediately started thinking, when do we get to 10? Then we hit 10. And I was like, well, we got to go to 20. And actually, in all honesty, I remember at 10 thinking, we're gonna hit 20, shortly, we got to get to 50. And now we're above 30. And I'm already thinking like, I can't wait till we hit 100 billion. So that, to me is a part of that's a part of what makes the community so special right now is I think that people derive a lot of joy from the work that is done, but are constantly hungry for that much more pushing, pushing the milestone markers further and further along.\nDAVID: Yeah. And I do want to return to sort of where you were. So you know, here you are, you're putting your kids to bed and sort of learning as much as you can about this industry that you've falling head over heels with what happens next?\n \nDEFI DAD: Yes, so yeah, I came home. And I remember distinctly, you know, talking to my wife about like, I don't know when this will happen, but I like really want to work in crypto. And at the time, I wasn't sure if that was related to Bitcoin or ethereum or defi wasn't even like a term at that time. But I also had a one year old child. So I do remember I like I definitely sort of shielded her from like, my real enthusiasm, like I was like, yeah, so this is something I want to be really involved with, you know, because we have a child now. And that's obviously my first priority and responsibility. But by January, I was proactively reaching out to recruiters, you know, basically asking, I want to work for a company in the crypto space.I somehow started to zero in on Ethereum. Like I knew that I wanted to work on ethereum at that point, but I can't remember what pushed me away from Bitcoin, maybe it was just I didn't see as many opportunities. Because I was equally as obsessed with both ethereum and Bitcoin at this point. I do remember, recruiters, you know, their job is just to get you recruited. So they can get paid and they had. So you have to keep in mind at this point, given my age, and my rank in this company that I was working for, I was on a team of like 20 sales people, it had grown from three to 20. And I had like, kind of like, taken up like a spiritual leadership on the team. I wasn't like the head of sales or anything. But it was it was it's a path a lot of people take you are a leader on the team, then you become a manager, then you become like a director like a head of sales. So recruiters are slinging these really great opportunities at me. And I am like, I am rejecting all of it, like won't even have an interview. I'm like, I don't want to talk unless the company works on ethereum. I only want to work in the crypto space. I don't and and when we're talking about that, like I'm willing to work on anything. I don't care if I'm a project manager, a salesperson, which seemed ridiculous. At that point. There weren't any sales people needed in the crypto space, unless you're talking about the enterprise blockchain. And I started I kept going to meetups and then I finally got ahold of a recruiter at consensus because Laura Shin of unchained. I had met her at a conference. And I was so blown away by the content she was creating. I thought she was I still would say that she was like one of the she was one of the main inspirations for me wanting to go work in now defi but in crypto ethereum and Laura was so kind and was like, you know, let me give you a few recommendations of places to go. We even talked about Actually, I forget about this. Laura helped me not just because I was nice to her, and because I like engaged her at a conference, it was because I offered to help her for free, because I was so hungry and desperate to want to work in ethereum or crypto. And I had said, seriously, like, Whatever you need, I felt like I owed her like, basically I felt like my life had taken like a great turning point. It was all due to her. So I, I did nothing more than I helped her set up like a CRM because she was, you know, doing lots of advertising. And she was really starting to like, she was already a huge deal in our space. But she was, you know, really getting lots of advertisers reaching out. I did that. I mean, he talked about like, the simplest bit of effort, it probably took me an hour, it was something I was very accustomed to doing. I showed her it. And I mean, we just had a really warm relationship from there. And she was always very gracious with her time and would respond to me about nothing questions that I had. And that was it. I started anyways, I got a referral to consensus. And it took me three months with consensus to get the job, I basically had to email a recruiter every week, he was one of the worst recruiters I've ever worked with. Just the guy probably couldn't spell his last name if he didn't have like a note in front of them. Just a complete idiot. So and I'm a nice person so that it's he said a benchmark and being a crappy recruiter. So I ended up finally getting the job. After literally project managing my like hiring process, I was like, almost like guiding them through like, Oh, so would you like me to meet with this person next, because I looked on LinkedIn. And I can see that this person is there. So I finally get this job. I joined the marketing team at consensus. And I worked with a team of about it was about 50 to 60 people. It was a wonderful team, I had this wonderful boss, who was the CMO at the time, Amanda Gutterman, who's now Amanda Cassidy, I just had this like lovely experience for two years. Amanda was just this, she was just this like very nurturing like leader to everyone on the team. She was very passionate about everything in in ethereum. I mean, we lived through, I joined in the summer of 2018. So the markets had already like, you know, gone down, like close to 50% from all-time highs. But everyone had this like hope that it wasn't, you know, that we weren't going to continue downwards. And then the market hit bottom by December. So I've been there six months, I watched, I think it was 15% of the company got laid off. And I like I still loved working. I just was like this is awesome. Like, I mean, not the layoffs,that was terrible. But I was like, it's so awesome to finally be at like the heart of ethereum at the heart of crypto and, you know, consensus worked on a lot of projects. So I was kind of I had this I was very fortunate, like I got to interface with a lot of people, you know, including like very sparing interactions with like meta mask and kind of just being an off like holy cow. Like these guys. No doubt, Dan Finley and meta mask are still you know what one of the one of the most important projects and ethereum, truffle, bitcoin as well, Kevin kawaki I've gotten introduced to and kind of was inspired by the work he was doing. So I worked there two years, but in my last year, so I worked there for basically six to nine months. And then ETHEREAL, which was put on by consensus. Funny enough, here's the event I had gone to I had skipped work paid $600 to go to it. And it turned out that this project manager on the team, she had gotten a job elsewhere and decided she was going to leave and I had this amazing opportunity to fill in. And so here it is full circle. Now I'm working on ethereal, which is the event that to me was kind of an inflection point in my life. You know of like holy cow like this is it like I want to work on this forever. And I got to spend the next basically the next little over a year working on these, you know conferences, which would normally happen during New York blockchain week. But we also went to Tel Aviv and then we ended up doing a virtual conference. Because in 2020, the pandemic happen, of course, so I got to just really like have this like joyous ride working on storytelling, which is why I love what you guys are doing with this podcast, and yeah, one of one of the best jobs to I've ever had, I mean, just it's so much fun to work on that storytelling. And you know, definitely like a credit to Joe Lubin was very generous with supporting ethereal, it was, it was the creation of Amanda, and a number of others on the team, before I ever joined. But I mean, man, they love, they love ethereal, I love ethereal. And that that leads to really now which is by the summertime. So during ethereal, what's happening is when I'm working on a cereal in the summer of 2019. So I have this background of literally spending every waking hour of the day giving demos in software, selling people on software, having, you know, customer support, with me to customize some pretty complex software that had 1000s of variables, and you would like map out business processes very similar to Salesforce. So that's a skill set. I'm thinking I'll never probably use in the near future with ethereum because there were just no apps that were alive at that point. I mean, everything was so archaic and augur was one of the few things but it wasn't, it was so hard to use. So summer of 2019, maker had about 500 million in total value locked, which was pretty remarkable. Compound now had 50 million. And I started using compound I just, I don't know what it was, but I was planning for ethereal in the fall. And I thought, it's so stupid that I'm setting up like these, these lineups and these narratives to play out throughout the event. I should really like explore some of these applications. I should like try them. Again, I was blind to like, other than maker, I wasn't quite sure of anything that was working very well. I got Yeah, I started using compound. And I remember I lent like 10 DAI. And like my mind was blown. I just was like, this is so radical. Wait a sec. So I just lent 10 dye and at that time, I think it was earning like 20%. And then my mind started to like, do the thing we all do in crypto and like if I put X amount of money, yeah, I would make this much. Except this time it made sense. It wasn't like, if I put in $1,000 and it goes up just 1000 x I'll be a millionaire. Which is that's that was the 2017 mentality. This was different. It was like this is a very like reasonable understandable mechanism. We are lending and others are borrowing. It's all verifiable. On the blockchain, I can see it an ether scan, I can verify how much money they have. I'm protected from credit risk, because if someone doesn't maintain their loan, they're just going to liquidate them anyways. I'm like, this is awesome. So I played with that I played with pool together. I played with token sets, token sets just at that point blew me away because I thought it was so cool that they automated trading strategies. And I saw it like this is a trading bot that lives on smart contracts. And like this is crazy powerful. And the fact that I could tell friends about it, like, hey, there's this thing, it's like a trading bot, but it runs on ethereum Hey, there's this thing you can lend and borrow. And it runs on ethereum Oh, what's so special about it one earning it was like again 20% on DAI, which even my father in law who's older and you know, pretty tech savvy, but not you know, couldn't give a shit normally about Ethereum was like what? You can earn 20% on dollars. And I'm like, Yeah, yeah, it's all it's all real. It works. I mean, I can show you how. So I started tweeting more aggressively about all this stuff. Like I went from like, I went from the thesis that I developed over that summer was that ethereum namely defi was already usable, and that the world was talking about it like it wasn't usable. Like we had many decades to wait until well, you know, web three isn't usable. Ethereum needs a better UX. And I was like, I don't think that this is hard to use, hardest part is whether you can manage to use like a meta mask or some other you know, ethereum wallet, which I recognize some challenges there at the time. But I'm like, I mean to earn 20% is pretty insane to earn. 10% on digital dollars is pretty insane. And by the time we got to September, which was when ethereal happened, I had played with zerion at the time I had so I had started to manage my portfolio with zerion. I invited them to ethereal. I had gotten to know Kiber network pretty well, understanding how important they were for sourcing liquidity hold together was just fun, because I told people, you know, it's a lottery where you can't lose, it's like going to the gas station, buying a ticket, coming home, playing the lottery consecutively for as many weeks as you want. And when you're like, you know what I'm done, I'm not going to win, this is stupid, you go back to the gas station, you return it, and they you know, they give you all your money back. And so all these stories were starting to play out in my head. And I was tweeting very short tutorials, typical sort of like emojis like 1234, here's what you do. And I was noticing that, I mean, even if I was getting just a few likes that I was helping lots of people, people were sending me messages. And I didn't know if they had $1. I didn't know if they had millions, I definitely actually met a few early on who had millions. And it was funny, they were asking me and I was giving them all this help. And I remember thinking like, I wish they would pay me like a little fee, because like, it seems kind of ridiculous that I'm like advising them and I really don't have that much money. But I guess so. This all ties back then to earlier in my life. Like I was approaching all of this the way I would have whether I was selling electronics at a small family business, whether I was you know, working in the lab with some really brilliant folks, you know, trying to do chemistry experiments I was, I was, you know, explaining every nuance to the people that would reach out to me, which I would still argue I still do, it's just harder to get to all of those messages. And finding that like, hey, like my ability to have taught chemistry, it's like, really helping me now like I'm, I'm using all the same tactics. And I'm making it very visual, everything I was doing was like, very visual, it was normally me like showing screenshots, putting, like, you know, just simple things, throw it into like a slide and put like arrows and point and make sure that it's so dummy proof that no one could possibly screw it up. And by the time the winter hit, I mean, I it was we were close to 1 billion in total value locked and, and I just, I felt like, like, this is the first time in my life I've ever known something before other people. And I'm like watching it play out in front of me like, like holy cow, like people really don't know, they're like under estimating that we're gonna hit a billion very soon. And my thinking at that time was, I think we are going to hit a billion and we're gonna go to 10 billion very shortly after people just don't realize it's harder to get to that that first milestone because just because of the network effects that happen. And yeah, I mean, just 2020 I like I would just sum it up. As you know, I lived two lives. One was working on ethereal, which was wonderful. And I was enjoying that with consensus. But every last minute outside of that I was focused on every new defi app that would come out, it was my goal to make a video as quickly as possible about it. I started to make videos in late May, mid to late May of 2020, which was really stepping things up going from like Twitter posts with simple instructions and screenshots to I'm going to make a full blown tutorial, I'm going to edit it, you know, if  I'm gonna make something that is probably not the best looking but it's, it's going to be easy to follow. And I would joke that it was it looked like a boomer got a hold of an iMovie or something like that. It was it was, you know, clearly not the best editing in the world. But it didn't matter because people just were so grateful because they had no other resource at that point. And by the end of the summer, I mean, gosh, I had like gotten to know zapper really well, I mean, I was kind of living through all the mania that everyone saw happened during the summer. And just thinking like, this is only the beginning. Like this is not a new, we're not in like a new bubble where we're gonna draw down 90% we're just in a little micro bubble of you know, stupidity, issuing worthless governance tokens, even though they were not awesome projects like yorne had launched, curve had already launched and issued a governance token, and then you have compound. So there was all sorts of quality there. But yeah, we got to the end of the summer. And I'm actually I'll pause there for a sec, but I can tell you about how we got started at zapper and all that.\n \nJACK: Well, I'm interested to keep going there. Because I think the zapper and yield TV part of the story is super interesting. And then you also becoming a community lead of some sort on Twitter.\n \nDEFI DAD: Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, there were, you know, a few other things I like left out that were happening along the way as I started making the ethereal podcast, that was so this all starts in the pandemic. Pandemic kicks off. I've never recorded a podcast, I've never done a video. So um,so the pandemic, at least in the United States got really rough around March. So March 2020. We're all now, you know, stuck inside, like the rest of the world. And, yeah, I had never recorded a podcast and I had never actually made a video and I had also never been in virtual reality. I had not bought a headset, like an Oculus headset. I'd never touched anything like crypto voxels. All these things happen at once. We were getting ready for ethereal which pivoted to a virtual conference in the spring. And I got introduced, because of the Twitter posts. I was making someone reached out and said, like, you know, you should explore. You should explore crypto voxels. And the token smart community had a number of people on their team who just were really cool, guys. I mean, it was Rizal and Jimmy. And then Matthew from cent, who works at cent but also is in the crypto voxels community and token smart. I mean, it was like a renaissance to me 2020 I feel terribly how rough it's been for so many but like for me like I discovered virtual reality and how like how much I loved it how interesting the metaverse is and how it ties into to defi to digital finance to native digital finance that can power the metaverse and, and NFT's I finally understood like, Oh, this is why people love NFT's because when you live in a native digital space, digital collectibles become that much more interesting and valuable to you. And by the time we had what hit the summer, I recorded like I think 15 ethereal podcasts, which are still all up but that was like that was definitely a passion project that went along with ethereal. I was I was making videos finally, and I was meeting all these teams and a lot of teams. I mean, still to this day, a lot of defi teams struggle to make resources that teach users, you know, beginners and advanced how to use it. I think we've come a long way. And I'd like to think like I've had some sort of impact there. There's actually there's a number of incredibly talented educators or educational content creators now in our space, too. So by the time I had hit, like I said, maybe August or something I was, you know, pretty close. In terms of contact with zapper I just thought zapper and zerion as well, I thought both teams and a few others were poised to be like the ultimate on ramps for defi. And I still think that too. I work at zapper but much love to my friends at zerion. And I yeah, I got got to August in one of the co-founders basically said, Hey, like, you know, we're growing at a crazy rate like, we'd love to have you join. The problem is that I was moving cross country. So I'm moving from California to the east coast at that point. I've got two kids. We're thinking eventually about buying a house. I mean, it is like the most stressful time of my life. We were packing up everything in our home, which is a complete nightmare. And, you know, there's the pandemic. We're prepping just to fly with two kids and a dog which is like ridiculous, like, try flying during the pandemic. Try flying with like a dog into kids. It's even worse. A Friday before we were moving literally. We were Leaving on Saturday. I think it was Friday, Zappar reached out and had said, Hey, you know, you know, we really appreciate all the content you've always done for us. You know, why don't you join the team, like we're not. And at the time, too, they were, they were like, we're not really sure what exactly that title or role is. But it's just, you know, the team at that point was like five or six people. And it was like, we need help with everything operations, marketing, support, just being in discord and supporting people with the knowledge that, you know, hey, I can help you with, with the troubles you're having in zapper. I mean, it was it, it was definitely an offer that like it appealed to me, but it was like, I now have two children and we're moving. And this all seems like a bit abrupt. And I thought about it I think for like, less than 24 hours and came back and was like hell yes. I want to I absolutely want to like this is all I want to work on. You know, I want to work on defi full time and ethereal was wonderful consensus was great to me, but just wanted to work full time on like, what was like my truest passion there. So you know, it's like all these dots makes sense to me now, as I'm like, looking back and connecting them. But now at zapper, I tend to focus on a few things. So I am a member of the core team of zapper, I don't think that the titles really matter. But we do joke around and actually state that my title is chief defi officer. So we, I tend to focus on, of course, understanding from users how we can make the product better, but that goes hand in hand with just living in our discord, which I would say a number of us on the team in between all the other things that we work on discord is one of the most important tools in crypto and defi right now. You get to interact with you get your users who come to you and give you every last bit of good and bad feedback. But you get this wide spectrum of users, both beginners and advanced who are asking, you know, the most important questions and I love it. I absolutely love it. It is chaos in our discord at all times. I mean, it's just an I mean, I've heard discord go off while we've been recording here, and I'm going to be I'm sure I'll come back to like a firestorm. But it reminds me also of all the customer service still, that is like in my background, like I spent so much time when I had a cookie business, I spent so much time in my father, my uncle's small family business, I spent a lot of time you know, just helping people, people that are sometimes very polite and people sometimes who are very angry and pissed off and rude, just a rarity and zapper but there's the person occasionally who burns through like point five ether and gas and their transaction gets reverted. And they come to you like what the hell just happened. I just lost like $500 you know, because they tried to trade when the markets were really volatile, and they put in a low gas price and it got rejected by uniswap. So  there's all of that the thing I love the most about working at zapper now is I focus on yield TV. So multiple times a week we host live streams. Normally it's Monday and Wednesday minimally but tends to be Tuesdays and Thursdays to every Monday we do defi class, we cover basics to fundamentals on all sorts of topics. We'll do like a class on how to master gas prices. We've done how to get started yield farming, and today we did one on defi indexes. So that is like the ultimate joy. That's what I was doing. You know, making videos as like a defi educator. But then we get to interview founders and we screen share with them every single yield TV, we do tons of screen sharing. There's only a few episodes where we haven't. And it's normally with investors. But everyone else we live. We show everything live and like I'm normally asking like pretty genuine questions that I'm kind of puzzled by myself as we're navigating it.\n \nJACK: It's crazy to see how enthusiastic you are about the space. And I guess just to play back into what you said before, about burnout, that you were nowhere near it. Does that start to impact your family life? What do they think about this? And do you still have time to be a dad outside of defi Dad?\n \nDEFI DAD: Yeah, it is. It's definitely challenging. I would say it comes in ebbs and waves like what happens is I will go through a period of clearly pushing boundaries like, you know, let's pretend if I did like a podcast multiple nights in a row, I know better than to do that now doing one a week, no problem. If I did multiple like, like, Hey, I got to go on, there's a clubhouse talk, I need to join or there's someone in Singapore, who wants to be on yield TV and like we're gonna do it late at night. So I've kind of figured out some of those. Those ways that I've pushed boundaries. I do have I think, like, weekend's I'm really good about sort of tuning out, I still track things on Twitter. And I'm still always like, I mean, my phone is always at my side. But I Yeah, I definitely like I think about, like, what you're saying, I think about this, because I talk with a lot of other friends who have kids, and we talk about the fact that it's like, your kids are only a little so long, and you really have to, like enjoy that. But then we're also sort of living through this remarkable, you know, revolution with money, Legos and defi. And so I don't know, I, I have tried to just be present when I can, you know, be as present as possible, like when I'm with my family. But I mean, my wife could tell you, I, I screw that up all the time. So if it comes again, there's, there's like weeks where I'm like, I'm doing really well. And then there's weeks where I start to revert back to bad habits.\n \nJACK: What are the bad habits look like?\n \nDEFI DAD: Oh, like, I'm kind of like what I was saying. It would be like being there with your kids. But I'm like, staring at my phone because I'm like staring at you know, God knows what, with some new defi app, or maybe I'm even trying to listen to I have done this before where I've like, tried to listen into a clubhouse talk. And like, my kids are like sleeping on either side of me. I'm like trying to put them to bed. It's kind of ridiculous. And then someone calls upon me this happened once I was in clubhouse, and someone called upon me and I was like, Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Sorry. Give me just a sec here. And pretend like I'm not like laying on my back with like, two little human beings cuddled next to me. Yeah, I think it comes down to like a presence thing, though. So I'm like, I think the fact that I'm conscious of it, though, is like a good thing. I think if I think the minute you're the minute that you think that you're doing enough, you're in a pretty bad place, then you're probably gonna get yourself in trouble with a with a partner. But all of my friends that are in this space kind of describe it the same way both men and women to like a number of women friends that I have in this space have said that their husbands are like, Good God, like Do you guys ever just turn off? Anything? You know, the answer is? No. Because it's, it is 24 seven. So, zapper though I will say this, if anyone is looking to work in this space, it is possible to have that normal support system. I would say zapper my team is incredibly supportive and respectful of like my time with family. They wouldn't bother me on a weekend. But I would say like, I'm pretty good friends with everyone on the team by now. So we're kind of like checking in like, Hey, man, what are you doing? You know, did you see such and such went up in price, things like that. So yeah, so I don't want to scare people away from working here. I've actually gotten someone recently I got I helped to get hired. That was a friend of mine. She is a mother and I think she found a great team. I think the team is the team has a great work culture and I think they'll be very supportive of like her being both a mother and also someone that works with them.\n \nJACK: Which team is that?\n \nDEFI DAD: Nexus actually Yeah, my friend Kendria got hired by Nexus mutual as a community lead Yeah, pretty, pretty awesome role. So another person who just was tweeting kendria someone I met because she was tweeting about God knows what and defy and I just thought that she had like really, really awesome like ideas and we started to sort of message and like answered questions here and there for her and she would reach out actually with awesome ideas was so I was learning from her as well. And there it is, you know I've never met her in person only talked through Twitter and then got to know her by you know, actually like reaching out and saying, hey, like what jobs are you applying to? Now she's got a job. It's pretty amazing.\n \nDAVID: And I guess on a final note, where can people go and find you?\n \nDEFIDAD: Yeah, so there's a few places most obvious is if you look up at defi underscore dad on Twitter, Everything every thought about defy try to post through there. It's really to just it's more of like a stream of thoughts to help people with defi, I still think like, basically 24 seven about like, if I were new, what would I want to know? So some of the topics are advanced, but I really do try to talk about more basic fundamentals like even gas prices. Another thing is what you guys mentioned earlier, if you go to TV dot zapper dot phi, or if you follow yield underscore TV, that's the place that you can watch live streams, those happen multiple times a week. So those are like defi classes to defi demonstrations. And that's all powered by produced by zapper. So that's a part of the work I do at zapper. And then the last place you got to defi dad dot com, that'll just redirect you to my YouTube channel, I tend to post more into yield TV now just because I literally doing shows there four or five times a week maybe. And so I would say that's the best place to be learning like off the cuff about all the new defi material. If you are brand new though to defi, and you are a crypto native. So at defi dad dot com, there's a playlist that's defi for beginners. That one is perfect for anyone who's who is a crypto native, but just wants to learn defi , enter into that. If you search DEFI 101, which is on the defiant YouTube channel, that is a web series with 30. That's 30 episodes that we collaborated to produce so I wrote them in the defiant produce them. We made that as a public good over the last six months. So that is to me like if you're new and you just want to know the basics, but don't want to get your hands dirty, defi 101 on the defiant news channel. And then if you're ready to actually get your hands dirty, that's where defi dad dot com becomes powerful. And that's it.\n \nDAVID: Right. Great. Well, they find that thanks very much for your time.\n \nDEFI DAD: Thanks for having me, guys. This is great. Thank you so much.\n \nJACK: And that marks the end of our episode at high definition. If you want to find out a little bit more about defI dad, go to our website at high definition dot efe dot link.
