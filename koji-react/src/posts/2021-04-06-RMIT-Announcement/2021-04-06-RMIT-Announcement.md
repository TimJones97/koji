One underlying force that galvanised the blockchain revolution was research. Decades of research in cryptography, economics, mathematics and sociology to help design a better system for communication, commerce and community.

Tracer DAO respects this historical commitment to research, and can announce the first globally recognised academic partner to actively participate in a DAO. RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub proposed a research collaboration on 25 March 2021, and was [successfully approved](https://vote.tracer.finance/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmUaFtGvtTa5cwHyG68K1MFbSjv1hL5f6oJqTcATe1cYfU) by Tracer DAO on 30 March 2021.

This partnership goes beyond existing examples of projects working with published authors and academics to write whitepapers. RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub commits to ongoing participation in voting, researching, writing and publishing, to broaden the spectrum of what can be achieved by Tracer.

For the Tracer ecosystem, RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub will:
- Publish articles related to Tracer;
- Publish academic papers, within relevant research journal(s);
- Speak at events relating to Tracer;
- Host or co-host DeFi conferences and events;
- Promote job opportunities relevant to Tracer DAO; and
- Engage with the community on Tracer's communications channels.

RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub is the worldâ€™s first business school research centre, focused on blockchain technology. The RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub team has interdisciplinary researchers in economics, political science, law, organisational theory, sociology, accounting, finance and communications.

Founded in 1887 and ranked 10th globally in the 2020 Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings, Melbourne-based RMIT is a global university of technology, design and enterprise, and the largest dual-sector education provider in Australia.

Tracer DAO welcomes this academic partnership, and will continue to design a more inclusive economy that drives prosperity.
